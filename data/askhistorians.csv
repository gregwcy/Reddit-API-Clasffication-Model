Today:

Welcome to this week's instalment of [/r/AskHistorians](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians)' Sunday Digest (formerly the Day of Reflection). Nobody can read all the questions and answers that are posted here, so in this thread we invite you to share anything you'd like to highlight from the last week - an interesting discussion, an informative answer, an insightful question that was overlooked, or anything else.",28
1,AskHistorians,t3_nvvd8w,"Short Answers to Simple Questions | June 09, 2021","[Previous weeks!](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/search?sort=new&amp;restrict_sr=on&amp;q=flair%3ASASQ)

**Please Be Aware**: We expect everyone to read the rules and guidelines of this thread. Mods *will* remove questions which we deem to be too involved for the theme in place here. We *will* remove answers which don't include a source. These removals will be without notice. Please follow the rules.

Some questions people have just don't require depth. This thread is a recurring feature intended to provide a space for those simple, straight forward questions that are otherwise unsuited for the format of the subreddit.

Here are the ground rules:

* Top Level Posts should be questions in their own right.
* Questions should be clear and specific in the information that they are asking for.
* Questions which ask about broader concepts may be removed at the discretion of the Mod Team and redirected to post as a standalone question.
* We realize that in some cases, users may pose questions that they don't realize are more complicated than they think. In these cases, we will suggest reposting as a stand-alone question.
* Answers **MUST** be *properly* sourced to respectable literature. Unlike regular questions in the sub where sources are only required upon request, the lack of a source *will* result in removal of the answer.
* Academic secondary sources are prefered. Tertiary sources are acceptable *if* they are of academic rigor (such as a book from the 'Oxford Companion' series, or a reference work from an academic press).
* The *only* rule being relaxed here is with regard to depth, insofar as the anticipated questions are ones which do not require it. All other rules of the subreddit are in force.",29
2,AskHistorians,t3_o0dn7y,"In fairy tales, there is a popular trope of beautiful damsels being locked away in a tower, only to be rescued by a clever beau. Was it really that common in the medieval period to trap women in obscure towers? If so, for what reasons were they put there?",,3061
3,AskHistorians,t3_o0w9hv,"In the Middle Ages, were merchants allowed to physically cut up coins for more exact transactions? Particularly in England? This is depicted in The Pillars of the Earth.","The author describes a wool merchant chopping a penny into quarters so that he could pay farthings. Was this allowed? Seems like any state concerned about forgery and debasement would also prefer to avoid defacement, and also that people would prefer to own whole coins.",40
4,AskHistorians,t3_o0ts67,Did English nobility get involved in the lives of their house-servants like in Downton Abby?,"I’m watching Downton Abby for the first time. In the show, the Crawley’s, who are the lords of the fictional Downton Abby estate, are very involved in the lives of the servants who work and live in their home. They know much about their personal lives, and even pull strings to get them other jobs, put in specific military units (during WW1 when the young men all get drafted), and so on. They are also very generous with their money, giving servants that they fire or that quit two months or more worth of wages before they leave the house. My question is, was this kind of behavior normal amongst the English landed nobility?",60
5,AskHistorians,t3_o0vd93,"Why did so many ancient cultures consider the heart, rather than the brain, to be the seat of the mind? Surely they must have noticed that head injuries frequently result in mental impairment and personality change, but chest injuries never do?",,39
6,AskHistorians,t3_o0ii71,"In BBC sitcom ""Blackadder Goes Forth"" eponymous protagonist tries to avoid combat by feigning madness ""doing the trick they all used to do in Sudan"". Was Anglo-Sudan war a particularly nasty business that British officers would also try avoid?",Or is Sudan campaign simply a convenient back story prior to the First World War? Wouldn't Boer campaigns make more sense in terms of horror of combat?,205
7,AskHistorians,t3_o0u9s9,"Why are the titles of the rulers of some cultures translated to European terms like ""king"", ""Emperor"" or ""chief""and some aren't?","Why do we say King Leonidas of Sparta, King Attila, King Shaka, Emperor Hirohito, Emperor Moctezuma and even Jesus King of the Jews (though I understand this last one was used derogatively) but with some specific cultures we preserve the term in the original language (Shah of persia, Khan of Mongolia, Kaiser of Germany, Pharaoh of Egypt?",31
8,AskHistorians,t3_o0u0e8,"How common was establishing a system of government based on strange women lying in ponds distributing swords in some farcical aquatic ceremony?

10,AskHistorians,t3_o0ctdy,"When did the age of massed musket armed 'line infantry' end, and were there any battles in which a force still fought in the old style of line ranks against whichever tactics replaced it?",,328
11,AskHistorians,t3_o038s0,"Roughly 2000 years ago, Paul the Apostle identified himself as a member of the Tribe of Benjamin. As far as I know, none of my Israeli or friends of Hebraic origins identify with any particular tribe of Israel. When and how did persons of Hebraic heritage lose their knowledge of tribal descent?","I understand that the term Jews nominally identify membership to the Tribe of Judah. My understanding, however, is that the term Jews is now an umbrella term for anyone claiming Hebraic descent, and not just limited to actual members of the Tribe of Judah. 

If all Jews were descendants of the Tribe of Judah, then what precisely happened to the other tribes? How come the Jewish diaspora enabled certain Benjamites to retain their identity at least 2000 years ago, but somehow lost such identity 2000 years later?",1712
12,AskHistorians,t3_o0tizu,Why aren't recorders part of modern orchestras?,"I have found some stunning examples of classical music in which recorders are used, for example, Vivaldi's Recorder Concerto RV 443, to great effect. So why are recorders now relegated to teaching instruments and not used in a standard orchestra?",17
13,AskHistorians,t3_o0ywsi,How did the sailors of the early-modern (and even before that) avoid things such as sunburn and sun glare while at sea?,"I had a chance to go on a boating trip with a few of my old pals the other day. It was my first time and I didn't bring my sunglasses and it was a very bright day. I struggled to not squint my eyes until one of my good friends offered me a spare sunglasses. The relief on my eyes were amazing and I must remember to personally thank the inventor of sunglasses in the afterlife.  


But it made me wonder. How did sailors before the invention of sunglasses (and sunscreen!) dealt with the problem? I know they probably wore hats but that didn't help much in terms of helping you look across the glimmering bright sea well. I've noted that black kohl are used by Asiatic nomads in arid areas but have no idea if Europeans or people in other places were aware of it (or if kohl did anything to help at all).  


Thank you in advance",6
14,AskHistorians,t3_o0wlge,McCullough vs History?,"In ""The Pioneers"", McCullough gives more than just an impression that Thomas Jefferson worked against the abolishment of slavery in what was to be the new State of Ohio, it seems to me that he basically states it as fact.  Yet, it sure seems that we've been taught that Jefferson was generally for the gradual elimination of slavery, and is credited with writing the Northwest Ordinance including the language banning slavery.  I'm having difficulty reconciling this difference...perhaps I've just read something wrong?",10
15,AskHistorians,t3_o0l0jy,"Alex von Tunzelmann implies that that the average Englishman was diseased, poor and illiterate vs his Moghul counterpart. How much poorer was the average Englishman in comparison to his Moghul counterpart?"," One was a vast, mighty and magnificent empire, brilliantly organised and culturally unified, which dominated a massive swath of the earth. The other was an undeveloped, semi-feudal realm, riven by religious factionalism and barely able to feed its illiterate, diseased and stinking masses. The first was India. The second was England.  

So begin's her *Indian Summer: The Secret History of the End of an Empire*. My question is, how much poorer was the average Englishman in comparison to the Moghul peasant? Also, what was the literacy rate in England vs India in the 18th century?",55
16,AskHistorians,t3_o0xcr6,How does an army fight a phalanx head on?,"I understand that with most instances throughout history, phalanxes were defeated by being outflanked, such as when the Romans feigned a retreat back up a hill to get a phalanx out of formation. However, I am confused about how w an army, even with superior numbers can physically fight a phalanx head-on and win.",5
17,AskHistorians,t3_o0rers,"From where did european ""medieval culture"" arise?","Let me just start by saying that firstly I understand that medieval culture isn't a monolyth and varied in many different regions of europe and times. However when talking popular about medieval times there are certain aspects that are almost always present, like knights and chilvary, vassalage, serfdom and castles.

When we picture europe in times after this, like the renaicensse or modernity, we usually can get a picture of how things came to be, culturally. However, looking at medieval europe, there seems to be a gap between the fall of rome and medieval culture. Most of Rome shown in movies and tv is late republic, so we see those senators with their robes, ordering slaves and so on.

My question is, what changed culturally in europe, for ""roman culture"" as shown to become medieval culture we perceive it?

PS: Maybe this is kinda obvious for europeans folks who may learn this at school. lol",15
18,AskHistorians,t3_o0n4c6,How did the Japanese public cope with/accept the atrocities their soldiers committed during WWII?,"I just finished up Dan Carlins Supernova of the East podcast..and some of the hardest stuff I've ever listened to. 

The way they treated Filipinos,  Koreans, Chinese, POW's, etc...just a shocking contempt for human life.",30
19,AskHistorians,t3_o0rajb,Cannabis in Archaeology,"  I have spent the last four years doing research on cannabis in archaeology as I pursue a Ph.D. in Paleobotany; my primary focus is on *Cannabis sativa* *L*.  While I have scoured through a 100+ journals to compile sites where *Cannabis sativa* L., or any plant in the *Cannabis/Hemp* family, has been recovered, I do feel like I may still be missing a lot. I have compiled all the sites throughout China that I have found, as well as one in Korea &amp; Japan, several through India, and a couple in Kazakhstan. I have used all this data in GIS to compile a map of every site aligned along the Silk Road, which is where I have run into my problem. 

   The data extends into South Korea, as well as every country in the middle east; I would like to hear of any archaeology sites that you are aware of where this species has been found, as I would like to dig for any journals that could provide me information that I can use to verify and add to my list. Most of the research that I have been able to find is fairly limited outside of China, and even that is not as thorough as it could be, considering China seems to like squashing any research on *cannabis*, even though its origins are there, and it has been such a pivotal part of their progression. 

   I know there are major trade routes all throughout the Middle East, Europe, and Africa whose trade goods were connected to the Silk Road, and I would like to compile all of these as well, so I’d greatly appreciate to hear about any archaeology sites that you may know of from any area, so that I can establish ties throughout the world. I appreciate any thoughts or information in this regard, thank you!",14
20,AskHistorians,t3_o0s1st,Which period in Europe saw a huge spike in suicides due to a great cultural shift and perceived loss of meaning of life?,"I have just finished listening to George Steiner's ""Nostalgia for the Absolute"" and throughout the lecture I couldn't stop thinking about what one of my uni professors said years ago - that during either Renaissance or the Enlightenment various prominent figures killed themselves due to loss of meaning of life when the dominant narrative shifted from a religious one to either humanist or scientific. Which period was it and were there other drastic cultural shifts that resulted in similar outcomes (World Wars 1 and 2 perhaps)?",12
21,AskHistorians,t3_o0fam9,"Historians, are there any notable instances throughout history of people forgetting important things?","It seems like the kind of thing that would intentionally be written out, but I’m wondering if there are any well-known (or not very well-known) instances where historical figures just sort of...forgot.",73
22,AskHistorians,t3_o0tjq7,"When did countries begin restricting the export of cutting-edge military technologies to stop ""less advanced"" countries from using them against them? Did the US stop the export of the Gatling gun, for instance?",,9

24,AskHistorians,t3_o090b0,"Is the Spanish Black Legend a real thing, or just an excuse from the Spanish far right to deny any atrocities committed by the Spanish Empire?","Is there are more nuanced analysis to take out of the ""Spanish Black Legend""? What amount of it is truth, and what is propaganda in bad faith?",217
25,AskHistorians,t3_nzs2dt,"In 9 AD, Wang Mang abolished slavery in China. Considering that slavery was universally normalized in the ancient world, what led Wang Mang to abolish slavery?",And how did he push through with this type of seemingly wide-scale reform? Was This action done out of some genuine desire to reform society or some sort of political scheme?,2915
26,AskHistorians,t3_o0zhqc,How come the post-Ottoman Balkan nations had German monarch rather than locals and why is Serbia different?,"Basically the title. With the Balkan wars of 1912 - 1913, the Albanians declared independence form the Ottoman empire and their first monarch was some Prince William of the German house of Wied.

Likewise, the Greek royal family after independence in 1832 was some House of Wittelsbach, which seems to have nothing to do with Greece. 

In Bulgaria you have Alexander of Battenberg as the first monarch after independence in 1878, later by Ferdinand of of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha.

The situation with Romania is similar.

What gives? I know that the royal houses of these countries were internationally agreed upon by the great powers but how come they were all Germans? And why not just leave these countries have one of their own leaders as a king? 

It is not like these German kings exercised foreign control in colonial style - all of them seem to have quickly become your run-of-the-mill nationalist for their adopted kingdoms.

At the same time, Serbia was the only Balkan nation to have their royal families come from the military leaders of the anti-ottoman movement - the Obrenovic and Karageorgevic dynasties came from Serbian society rather than be implanted from the outside like all these German guys in Greece, Albania, Bulgaria and Romania. Why was Serbia different in this regard?",2
27,AskHistorians,t3_o0p0tr,Why didn't any of the Great Powers that took part in the Crimean war on behalf of The Ottomans participate in the Russo-Turkish war (1877-1878)?,"I have always wondered what was that, that stopped the UK or France to come to the aid of the Ottoman Empire, but said countries could influence greatly the last draft of the treaty that was signed by Russia and the Ottoman Empire (Treaty of Berlin 1878).

I have read very vague answers on the internet, but nothing that really satisfies my curiosity. I haven't seen any posts in this subreddit that answer my question either. Thanks in advance for any answer.",12
28,AskHistorians,t3_o0z86e,Was Erwin Rommel a nazi by ideology?,I hear people arguing about it all the time but I just wanna know.,2
29,AskHistorians,t3_o0ork2,Armenian Genocide and Famine?,"I was recently arguing with an Armenian Genocide denier and he claimed that the whole Ottoman Empire was going through a famine due to the war. (Therefore, the Armenians weren’t purposely starved etc.) I haven’t been able to find anything about this famine. Was there a famine or is this made up?

Also, if anyone could point me to some good sources to debunk common denialist claims, that’d be nice.",13
30,AskHistorians,t3_o0n603,Native Americans who left reservations after WWII,"American Indians had a large amount of participation in WWII. As I understand it, this led to somewhat of a exodus from the reservations afterwards.  I'm curious as to how much of this came from former soldiers v. those that worked in other capacities (factories, etc.) during the war.

I'd like to learn more about that exodus, including if it's worthy of the title. It seems economics play big part, as poverty was high on reservations. And many were in isolated places with fewer job opportunities, to say the least.

But it's a big change. I'd like to see any sources or memoirs or polls on what the biggest motivating factors were. How old were the those that left compared to those that didn't?  What percentage were husbands or fathers?  What percentage were women, rather than soldiers? Did those individuals leaving contribute other people (who hadn't previously left) leaving - I've read about immigrants recruiting families to their new home, and I wondered if the same applied here.

Racial discrimination was hardly non-existent, and so the difficulties faced there are definitely worth reading about in the 1945-1955 era I'm thinking about.  What opportunities did they actually have, and what was the impact of the GI bill?  I know many Black Americans were shut of the advantages, and was curious to if similar happened to American Indians.

I'm also interested in the memoirs of children as well as adults who moved then.  It's a migration I think it'd be interesting to learn more about.

If there are any analysis that looks at individual tribes instead of grouping them altogether, that would be fantastic. Especially ones that compare, just because I'm interested in why different people made different decisions, not only at an individual level, but also at a group level.",17
31,AskHistorians,t3_o0g6qa,How successful were the Muslim conquerors of Spain at converting the Christian population to Islam? Do we know how they went about it? How quickly did their subjects convert to Christianity after the Reconquista?,,37
32,AskHistorians,t3_o0ls6w,The Warsaw Uprising triggered massive reprisals by the Germans and led to the destruction of most of the city. Why did the Home Army launch the uprising if the Red Army was on the verge of capturing Warsaw anyway?,,19
33,AskHistorians,t3_o0osi6,Looking for books on the Zhou and Tang dynasties.,"I have three months off of work and am now working on a personal project to determine key factors of the falls of empires, dynasties and ages. Its more of a hobby to keep my mind busy however I cannot find many, if any books on the Zhou and Tang dynasties in ancient China. Especially ones that detail both the rise and fall of the dynasties themselves as well as how they sustained themselves for so long. Does anyone have some recommendations? Thanks in advance!

If anyone has any other books about various empires, or anything that would help me please say.",11
34,AskHistorians,t3_o0wap9,Was there an ethnic difference between celtiberians and Celts?,,3
35,AskHistorians,t3_o0lc78,"Could a knight stop being a knight? If so, how did they quit?","I recently remembered a fantasy book I've read as a child where King made some questionable decisions and one of the knights came to him, threw his sword on the floor before King's feet and then just left. I know that books set in medieval times (especially the fantasy type) are usually far from reality but this scene got me curious on how was it actually done. How did they resign? Was it some kind of symbolic ritual or did they had to go to the King and explain why they don't want to work for him anymore?

Thanks in advance for any answers :)",16
36,AskHistorians,t3_o0motx,What Was Trans-Atlantic Ocean Liner Travel Like In The 1840s?,I am curious about when the age of sail gave way before the coal tenders and when ocean liners started catering to the affluent as well as the immigrants. I've been reading about the SS Great Britain which was designed by Isambard Brunel and I am curious as to what a trip on the SS Great Britain would've been like in the 1840s.,12
37,AskHistorians,t3_o0j2lt,[Peace?] How did the post-WWII occupations of Japan and Germany affect Japanese and German historiography?,,20
38,AskHistorians,t3_o0rw1r,Are there primary sources that depict Persephone as a willing bride rather than as an abducted wife?,"Lately I've been seeing people discuss versions of the Hades and Persephone myth where Persephone actively wants to run off to the Underworld with Hades. There's usually an implication that this is part of an older narrative, if that helps. 

My own haphazard research hasn't turned up any primary sources that fit that description, and is mostly restricted to later classical sources. I was wondering if anyone had any more information on this narrative, and how it connects to primary sources? 

I'm sort of suspecting that this might be a modern way to square depictions of Persephone as happily married to Hades with our views on autonomy and morality. But a lot of the discussion of this topic specifies that the elopement version is older than the abduction version, and I'm very aware I've got gaps in my knowledge.",5
39,AskHistorians,t3_o0riys,Did the early Muslims only fight wars because of self-defence or did they also initiate wars themselves?,"When I refer to the Early Muslims, I mean the Prophet Muhammad PBUH and the first four caliphs after him. I studied Islamic in school and we always learned that they only fought wars because they were attacked first, never initiating a war themselves. Is this true? If it's not, what were their motives behind the wars they initiated. Thanks.",4
40,AskHistorians,t3_o0kp29,"How did boxing, wrestling or other sports leagues where fluids can be easily mixed react at the onset of the HIV epidemic?","With certain restrictions in place to curb the spread of COVID, what kind of changes were made to accommodate HIV.

41,AskHistorians,t3_o0dj6t,Why are so many people more attracted to the 20th century history ?,"Hello, I have been wondering for a long time why most non historian people get more interested in the 20th century than in other eras. I find the 20th century interesting but every time I see another non historian picking an era to study, it's always the 20th century, or when I find Instagram accounts about history, most of them are about WWII, why ?",33
42,AskHistorians,t3_o0vfri,What oral history do we have about Monte Alban?,"The Zapotec (Be’ena’a) city was only abandoned in 900-1000 AD. The Spanish only arrived 500 years later. But there’s precedent for [oral history to go back over 10,000 years](https://theconversation.com/ancient-aboriginal-stories-preserve-history-of-a-rise-in-sea-level-36010)! Is there really no oral documentation on Monte Alban at all?",2
43,AskHistorians,t3_o0yu0t,I vaguely remember a history channel special about two guys and a tower or house facing the wrong way or something.,It's vague in my mind but the story revolved around two men and some sort of feud or disagreement regarding a piece of land with a tower or building on it which was thought to be in one location or possibly facing a certain direction. But upon the death of it's owner was found to not be. I believe it was insinuated that the discrepancy was some sort of prank. I have no idea where this took place.,0
44,AskHistorians,t3_o0t0e4,"Based on the diet + training methods of their time, were ancient warriors (from the dawn of martial arts to the end of the melee combat) fit as we see in fiction?","Hi!

We are used to see warriors from the ancient ages (let's say 4000 BC. from the dawn of melee weapons to the late 1600s AD, until the age of gunpowder) fit and muscular.

I remember that once, in my school, my History teacher said (we were anxious for 300 by Zack Snyder) that most of the Spartans were very thin because they ate only seafood.

So my question is - is it possible to know if ancient warriors were fit or is just appealing from the media? 

Did their diet included lots of proteins? Did they train at primitive gyms? And genetics?

45,AskHistorians,t3_o0sxzd,When and how did the idea of exercise explicitly for health purposes begin to emerge?,"Perhaps I'm wrong about this, but I assume that, given the high levels of physical activity in the distant past, deliberate exercise was not really a thing; as a result, I was wondering when exercise for the purpose of health really began to emerge. 

To be clear, I don't mean training a skill (e.g. an athlete practicing), but rather exercising because you need to do it to keep your body healthy.",3
46,AskHistorians,t3_o0mfuz,Can the Book of Kings be taken as a historically accurate account of the religious world of the nations of Judah and Israel?,"The question came up in [this recent thread](https://np.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/o038s0/roughly_2000_years_ago_paul_the_apostle/) regarding Paul identifying himself as being from the tribe of Benjamin. The top response there makes no distinction between historical evidence and foundational mythology when telling the story of the Twelve Tribes, which at least from my understanding is likely more mythology than history. In that regard, I dug around and found Diana Vikander Edelman reasonably summarizing what I've gathered from Kings. In her [The triumph of Elohim : from Yahwisms to Judaisms](https://books.google.com/books?id=bua2dMa9fJ4C&amp;pg=PA27&amp;lpg=PA27&amp;dq=%22this+picture+should+be+seen+as+the+product+of+an+exilic+or+postexilic+theology%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XX0OMB4mEu&amp;sig=ACfU3U1622Ixosn4NifDXGXuLShEOgCcIQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi21uerlJrxAhUVVs0KHeADC-MQ6AEwAHoECAMQAw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false) she explains:

&gt;It is fairly well established by now that the narrative of the book of Kings cannot be taken as an accurate reflection of the religious world of the nations of Judah and Israel. The cults of Jerusalem and Samaria appear therein as respectively, the repository of a proper religious tradition with lapses into heterodoxy and the fiendish creation of a sacrilegious traitor. This heterodoxy is portrayed by means of presenting those, wished to be denigrated by the author, as being worshippers of a pantheon rather than being loyal devotees of the one ""true"" God. As it is clear that the authors of the present material have a theological ax to grind, this picture should be seen as the product of an exilic or postexilic theology rather than a reflection of a real religious past.

Edelman then goes on to explain that Kings surely describes the time in which it was written to some extent, but I'm hoping a historian here can elaborate on how much of such scripture is corroborated by other evidence in the historical record. In particular I'm curious: how much prior to Paul's time can it be reasonably estimated that Israelites started seeing themselves as descendants of twelve distinct tribes?",9
47,AskHistorians,t3_o0ygir,"In the Age of Exploration, how dangerous were the trips themselves?","Maybe I'm phrasing this question wrong, but when people left to explore new lands was there a half-expectation they wouldn't make it back?

52,AskHistorians,t3_o0tm9x,Why did the Giza pyramid builders not fully enclose the interior chambers to make pillaging more difficult?,"The Egyptian pyramid builders were certainly aware of looting and pillaging. From my reading about them, I learned they had the full interior plans from the beginning of the project, and the interior chambers were formed as the structure was built up layer by layer.

This led me to wonder why they did not fully enclose the interior chambers to make looting much more difficult, rather than create exterior or near-exterior accesses. It would require completing the structure after anyone to be entombed had died, but that seems possible, and I can't imagine they wouldn't have considered it. Did they want access in their own era, and if so, what was so compelling to offset the certainty of future pillaging?  Or why did they not at least fully brick in the accesses?

Also, if I may ask a second... I know refurbishment of great historical works is contentious, but it has happened in many cases. For example, restoration of Michelangelo frescoes, or maintaining vintage aircraft in flying condition. The loss of the pyramid casing stones must have greatly reduced the expected lifespan, due to erosion. Some smaller pyramids have already lost fully half their original height! Has it been considered to replace the casing stones to prolong the pyramids for people to enjoy many thousands of years in the future? Today we could avoid the engineering mistakes that led to the loss of these stones. It may be beyond the resources of modern Egypt alone, but these are among the most impressive accomplishments of humanity, and I think humanity collectively should fund maintaining them. I hold the view that it is OK to maintain great historical works, so long as the intent of the creators is respected and the work is done with care. I would like to think the original pyramid architects would be in favor of this as well.",2

73,AskHistorians,t3_o0ic9s,"Did Luther really say 'the princes of this world are gods, the common people are Satan'?","While reading Sabine's *A History of Political Theory* I came across the following passage, apparently quoted from Luther.

&gt;The princes of this world are gods, the common people are Satan, through whom God sometimes does what at other times he does directly through Satan, i.e., makes rebellion as a punishment for the people's sins. I would rather suffer a prince doing wrong than a people doing right.

Sabine cites this as

&gt;Quoted by Preserved Smith, *The Age of the Reformation* (1920), pp. 594 f.

But when I looked up the actual work it was taken from, I couldn't find any results on the internet—just looking up the quotation gets you either a lot of anti-Lutheran pages without any sources, or cites Sabine, or cites Smith. I initially thought it might be Address to the German Nobility or Luther's polemic about the Great Peasants' war but became fairly sure it wasn't, but I found Smith's book [on Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/cache/epub/18879/pg18879.html) and he's very vague about the source as well:

&gt;While Luther cared enormously for social reform, and did valiant service in its cause, he harbored a distrust of the people that grates harshly on modern ears. Especially after the excesses of the Peasants' War and the extravagance of Münzer, he came to believe that ""Herr Omnes"" was capable of little good and much evil. ""The princes of this world are gods,"" he once said, ""the common people are Satan, through whom God sometimes does what at other times he does {595} directly through Satan, *i.e.*, makes rebellion as a punishment for the people's sins."" And again: ""I would rather suffer a prince doing wrong than a people doing right."" Passive obedience to the divinely ordained ""powers that be"" was therefore the sole duty of the subject. ""It is in no wise proper for anyone who would be a Christian to set himself up against his government, whether it act justly or unjustly,"" he wrote in 1530.

If they were allies, then maybe they would have? 

I know my family name dates back to the Norman Conquest of England, and that they most likely came from Bayeux. From what I’ve gathered Bayeux was populated mostly by the descendants of Scandinavians and whoever was local that they intermarried with. My paternal haplogroup is one that’s found most prevalently in England, the Low Lands, and Scandinavia. So, that doesn’t help much with determining where my paternal ancestry comes from other than the fact that they were Germanic.

It would be interesting to know the likelihood of them having been either of Scandinavian descent, or of West Germanic descent instead.

My question pertains to the role of America in the depopulation of the Natives.

The insinuation that Hoover liked to cross-dress has a long-standing, shameful insult. But from my recollection of M\*A\*S\*H, even though Klinger was portrayed as ""not real trans"", and was only looking for a Section Eight...  but I recall an episode where he'd given up wearing women's clothes chasing the Section Eight, but he took to wearing women's under-clothes ""because he liked the feeling"". And it was passed off as a gag, but still it seems to show Trans acceptance in a nonchalant manner.

Of course, there's [this](https://outsider.com/news/entertainment/mash-why-did-jamie-farr-stop-recurring-gag-wearing-womens-clothes-later-years/) article reporting that the actor specifically wanted to move away from the gag of regularly wearing women's clothes because Farr feared that his kids would be mocked in school, so it seems that even the actor recognized there was still a serious stigma.

132,AskHistorians,t3_o07udc,A few questions about medieval lords and aristocrats living in a city. And some questions about guilds.,"For the most part, I understand the hierarchy of the kings down to barons. Those types usually live outside the city and own lands of their own within the kingdom.

However, I'm a little confused as to what type of wealthy people, lords, ladies, other aristocrats would live within the city.

For example, let's say someone wealthy was hosting a party for other wealthy aristocrats. What other types of wealthy people from within the city would show up? Would those guests all be lords and ladies? Are all aristocrats lords and ladies? Would they be guild leaders? Would there be multiple people from the same guilds there?

I can only assume the types of wealthy people who live within a city are those who have business there. This leads to me people who guilds. Which I am also somewhat ignorant about. So I have a few questions about them as well.

Would there be guilds who compete against each other? By that I mean would there be two identical fishing guilds competing with each other trying to establish trade with business owners? Offering better prices, things like that? Or would there be only one fishing guild, and you'd have two different people from that same guild compete against each other?

What I imagine is a party of aristocrats rubbing elbows, talking business and solidifying deals with each other. And people competing for... the best trading prices on exotic spices or something. Those two spice merchants would belong to the same guild, yes? Or would they be from two separate guilds?

I guess my main questions are:

1. What types of wealthy people live within a medieval city?
2. Perhaps a better question would be, which types of people are considered the rich upper class of a medieval city?
3. Do these wealthy people live in manors/expensive houses inside the city? Or are they all visiting from out of town?
4. If some wealthy aristocrat throws a party at their house/manor in the city, who shows up?
5. Are all aristocrats considered lords/ladies? Or are aristocrats just rich people?
6. Are there identical guilds that compete with each other?
7. Or do people within a guild compete against each other to get more business?

I've grown up in the U.S.A. my entire life. To say I've taken most of it with a significant grain of salt is an understatement but throughout my life I've largely been taught that when we went to war or used our influence (whether abroad or domestically) that it always had a virtuous silver lining. People would often purport that we're the hero's. That being said it often feels that in reflection we're more often like the Fire Nation in ATLA; ambitious, self-serving, and often just generally bad. To drive the point home: We are often taught about the wartime atrocities of foreign powers but very few people talk about the Japanese internment camps or trail of tears.

Based on proven historical context would you say that the West's interpretation of history is generally more accurate or is there a different version of history which rings more true?

In 1944, following Tito's orders, their lands and belongings were confiscated. My grandmother was put in an internment camp and my grandfather was in the Arbeitseinsatz. 

After the war, they were in a refugee camp in Germany for about five years, as they had no home and no papers and were, technically, stateless. From here, they claimed to have been given the choice between Canada or Brazil and chose Canada. They said they didn't pay for these tickets and didn't choose their destination: they were simply given passage on a boat to Montréal and then a train ticket that took them to Toronto. They arrived in October 1953.

It is only in the last year or so that this detail - that the German government paid for their immigration - has really stuck out to me.

The typical image of a lobotomised person in media is practically a zombie; stuck in a permanent stupor and lacking agency, personality and identity. The popular perception of the procedure is that it was carried out by unsympathetic doctors purely to render a person passive and cooperative by destroying their mind and leaving them a barely cognisant empty shell. 

How accurate is this picture to the typical experience of mental patients who underwent the procedure? Was it the desired and universal result or just a worst-case-scenario outcome that became popularised due to its morbidity? Did lobotomy have any redeeming value for the patient beyond making them easier to manage? Are there any examples of ""success stories"" in which the patient's life was improved and they remained a more-or-less fully functioning individual? 

There is the famous case of Rosemary Kennedy, who is basically the poster child for all the terrible things associated with lobotomy; patients left unable to even communicate properly and completely debilitated in ways that didn't justify any impact it could have on symptoms of mental illness.

I'm 19 now. My grandma passed away last May (not from covid, just old age). I miss her so much, I want to do things that would make her proud of me. I worry quite frequently that my mental illnesses (BPD mainly) have made me stupid. I know some can wear away at your memory and learning capabilities I feel slower and foggier these days. 

Gammy was basically a genius! I could offer more context on that if anyone asks. I love to brag about her. One of her favorite subjects was history. Lately I've been thinking a lot about how interested I used to be in the subject. School kinda crushed my interest because so much of it was just memorization and repetition.

I find myself going down wiki holes about random historical things a lot (British monarchy, ghost towns in the US and their origins, how fancy rats came to be, etc). I enjoy them a lot, but I struggle to understand things that have actual significance to human history.
 
My issue seems to be that I cannot learn/comprehend an event or subject without knowing everything that was going on in the world at that time, what happened before, and what happened after. It's like my brain gets angry and frustrated when it doesn't have a complete timeline of everything ever, but there's no way to do that without learning about individual events and then stitching them together. My head gets to overwhelmed when I start reading about things because all it does is try to zoom out to everything all at once. My eyes hurt just thinking about it. 

The only solution I can think of is to find something that gives me a brief overview of the entire span of human history so my brain can form a rough timeline. But a brief overview of the entire span of human history is uh. Not possible. At least I don't think it is. 

I desperately want to find a strategy for learning about history that works for me. It's incredibly frustrating and humiliating to read things over and over and have nothing click properly in my head. I feel so stupid. 

TLDR: Brain wants everything all at once and refuses to learn about individual events without every ounce of context possible. Result is headaches and no retention of information. I feel dumb.

If anyone has any suggestions, please let me know! Especially those who have a similar issue or have ASD or ADHD. I want to get past this barrier so I can learn!",11

\-the 1832 Reform bill excluded working-class men with a property qualification, but the 1867 lowered the property qualification so that more men in Britain could vote. It seems strange that the 1867 bill opened the franchise to some working-class men (and lodgers who paid rent of £10 or more a year) while at the same time denying all women (including elite women) the vote. Why did property rights trump education? Elite women were probably better educated than some of the lower-class male voters...

\-Most of the sources I've been reading about the 1867 Reform Bill state that this bill denied women the vote, but they don't explain why. I know Mill tried to pass a bill to get property-owning women the vote in 1867 (on the same grounds as the newly enfranchised men), but his motion was ridiculed and defeated. I think on the whole, Mill's strategy was clever - he wasn't pushing for the vote for married women (they did not have property rights until the married women's property rights in the 1880s) - he was strategically advocating for voting rights for property-owning women. But why was his motion unpopular? Just widespread patriarchy at the time?

Charlie Chaplin married several women and in each case they were significantly younger than he was.

That is actually the current age at which a person can marry in the UK, albeit only with parental consent, but despite that it's safe to say that some of these marriages would be criticised were they to take place today and Charlie Chaplin would almost certainly find himself a target of the #MeToo movement.

The existing answers are in my opinion rather insufficient; although they correctly point out that the Germans persecuted groups other than Jews, they do not really address the root question.

Someone asked a similar question here two years ago and the existing [answer](https://www.reddit.com/r/AskHistorians/comments/a4ptjd/mistaken_identity_in_nazi_germany/ebl25we/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3) explains various ways that the Nazis identified their Jewish victims and focuses on the difficulty that Jews would have trying to hide their identity from the Nazis. 

I am not asking in general whether the Nazis had a difficult time identifying their victims, but rather what the Nazis themselves thought about the ""tradeoff"" between ""false positives"" and ""false negatives"" and if there are any known cases of ""false positives.""

However, in the 16th century, the Catholic Church would finally meet an intractable opponent in Martin Luther. Despite incurring the ire of the Catholic Church and Holy Roman Empire, Luther's critiques would serve as the basis for the Protestant Reformation, and initiate what at that point was the greatest ""thought revolution"" in European history. Protestantism spread throughout northern and central Europe, even outside of Luther's native Germany. In contrast to being burned at the stake, Luther would die of natural causes as a free, venerated man. My question could be phrased in a few ways, but I think I'm basically getting at this: Why did Luther's critiques — as opposed to those of Wycliffe and Hus — become the foundation for *the* rupture of the Catholic Church? How was he able to evade the threats posed by the Church, and why did his ideas spread so widely and resonate so strongly? Had something about Europe changed by this point compared to the periods in which Wycliffe and Hus lived, or was there something about Luther's critiques that were fundamentally different and more appealing?",75
232,AskHistorians,t3_nzkz5a,When did the president's security become what it is today?,"Hello. I've been thinking about security of public figures lately and came to wonder. When, and how, did the US president's security became what it is today? When I think about said security I think about most of it: security detail, a motorcade, food testing, snipers on roofs, background checks on talk show staffs, the whole thing.

Naturally, I understand why such security is required, but I wonder when and how did it develop over time.

249,AskHistorians,t3_nyw2g5,"When the Swedish parliament was looking for a new king, did they ever consider the Ethiopian royal family?","The story of how and why Jean Bernadotte became king of Sweden is pretty crazy to say the least, if I saw it in a movie I would say it was totally absurd, but it happened

Now, if I understand correctly, the Swedish parliament had a few requirements that wanted to fulfil:

* The monarch must not be related to the current royal family, since they feared no matter how they chose it would start a civil war

* The monarch must be christian, because church and state were so intertwined back then

* The monarch must be competent, because they feared they were one or two wars away from being annexed by Russia

* The monarch must not be aligned with Russia because of the previous point

And they looked all over Europe for a good candidate, with royal people rejecting the offer left and right, until the representative they sent to Napoleon met this random guy, he liked him, and he offered him the throne

Now, there was one royal family that met all their requirements but they never contacted: the Ethiopian royal family

They were christian, a different kind of christian but that hasn't been a problem, many monarchs became protestant or catholic for political reasons. They were competent, maybe not all of them, but in the Ethiopian royal family there had to be at least a few competent people, after all they successfully resisted the Ottomans and Europeans for centuries. And finally they were completely unrelated to any European royal family and to Russia.

Of course there was the issue with racism, but they ended up choosing a literal peasant, a son of a farmer with no prestige at all. In contrast the Ethiopian royal family was a centuries old dynasty, ruling an ancient and respected nation, one of the first to convert to christianity, heck, they could have argued they were descendants of the legendary Prester John... although maybe I'm wrong and racism was such a big issue they would have preferred any white person before a king with dark skin

In summary, given my understanding of that situation, the Ethiopian royal family was the ideal place for the Swedish parliament to look for a new king, but they never even considered it, and I don't know why",403

I’m currently reading Geoffrey Ellis’ *Napoleonic Empire* and was curious to see what happened to the various land-grands, deeds, titles, or *rents* (French), etc., given out by Napoleon during the Grand Empire’s existence.  
  
For example, of the “twenty two ‘ducal grand-fiefs’ (*duchés grands-fiefs de l’Empire*) created by a series of decrees on 30 March” of the year 1806 — what state were they in come, say (date is rather arbitrary), 1820? Would those who were granted the title of ‘ducal grand-fief’ have maintained their right of male primogeniture succession after France’s loss to the Seventh Coalition? Or, as I suspect is more likely, would those lands have been reclaimed as ‘spoils of war,’ or some other effect?  
  
I’m just generally curious as to the state of the landholders (who were made landowners due to Napoleon’s Grand Empire) after Napoleon himself abdicated, and his empire was torn apart.

What weapons were used? Swords ofcourse. What about glaives, axes, hammers, spears, javelins? What weapons did the cavalry use? Were there weapons unique to China not seen during the same period in Europe and Africa?

I vaguely remember reading that crossbows were a game changer and a big factor in Qin's winning streak. Is this true? If true, Why didnt the other states also effectively fight back with crossbows. Also how are crossbows used in battle? Are the crossbow units mounted on cavalry, or is it not possible to shoot from a crossbow on horseback? Were crossbows only used defensively behind a shield wall?

How was the army split up. What percantage were the archers, the cavalry and the infantry? Were there other units? Were there war chariots? Camels existed in China, were they used? What about mules? Oxens for pulling carts? What other animals were used in chinese warfare? Were there any elephants in China (even if not used for war)

How was Qin suddenly able to overcome every city's defenses when just before that taking a single city with high walls would sometimes take years?

How different were chinese wars from others of the same period. Romans fought in 3 lines. But the chinese numbered over a million in some battles. Were they spread out for hundreds of miles in only 3 lines or was it much thicker? If the lines were 5 or 10 people thick, wouldnt the ones at the back have nothing to do, and wouldnt the ones at the front be boxed in by the ones behind them? Did each soldier fight all day or was there a system to take breaks?

Were there plans and formations akin to those of alexander. How many days or weeks or months were the individual battles?

263,AskHistorians,t3_nz6nhv,Did German soldiers not use paprika for cooking goulash during WW2?,"Hello, one of my hobbies is cooking WW2 field rations, and as a non-German speaker with no close German friends to ask for aid, google translate is my only option. Recently I am translating some recipes in a Wehrmacht cookbook called, ""Feldkochbuch für behelfsmäßiges Kochen und Backen in den Kolonien (Field cookbook for makeshift cooking and baking in the colonies)"", that was published in 1941. What I am wondering is that did German soldiers not use paprika when they made goulash. Here are the original text from the book and my translation from google translate:

&amp;#x200B;

Gulasch.

Eine Portion Fleisch wird in etwa walnußgroße Würfel geschnitten, 1 bis 2 Eßlöffel Fett werden im Kochgeschirr zerlassen und das Fleisch darin angebräunt. Einige getrocknete Zwiebeln, Kümmel, Pfeffer und Salz werden hinzugetan und wenig Wasser zugegossen. Das Kochgeschirr ist dann zudecken und der Inhalt langsam zu schmoren. Zum Andicken der Tunke wird etwas Mehl mit wenig kaltem Wasser angerührt und zugegeben.

&amp;#x200B;

Goulash.

A portion of meat is cut into walnut-sized cubes, 1 to 2 tablespoons of fat are melted in the cookware and the meat is browned in it. A few dried onions, caraway seeds, pepper and salt are added and a little water is poured in. Then, the cookware must be covered so the contents slowly get braised. To thicken the sauce, mix a little flour with a little cold water and add in the soup.

&amp;#x200B;

I thought what makes goulash different from other common European stews and soups is the use of paprika, and I was quite surprised when I first read the recipe. What I know of is that in 1941, the German supply system wasn't very good, but wasn't dreadful yet. I also found a blog post with other German Army goulash recipes that was also published in 1941, and in the translated recipes, paprika was on the ingredient list. So here are my questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. Did I miss the German word for paprika somehow by using google translate? or
2. Did the German Army actually not supply paprika due to the wartime shortage? or
3. Is it just because this cookbook is for the makeshift cooking?

264,AskHistorians,t3_nzmt4g,i have some questions about Korean military history," 

1- Was there a special term or adjective for Korean swordsmen?

Spanish called their swordsmen rodelero, British sometimes called them man at arms and sometimes swordsmen, Japanese called them kenshi kenji or samurai (samurai used multiple weapons including guns but they primarily trained with sword) and Arabs called them Sayaf.

Did Koreans had class of swordmen? If not, did they constitute melee arms with spearmen?

2- Korean imperial army

After spread of guns, British infantry dropped the use of men-at-arms and started using the term redcoat. French had Mousquetaires and then the Legion. Ottomans had janissaries but later they started use of term ""asker"" after Mansure-i Muhammediye reforms. Did Korean imperial army had nickname for infantry?

3- Foreign policy of Joseon and Korean Empire

I can get all facts about Ottoman, German, Italian, British and French foreign policies at the time but Korean Empire is almost never mentioned. They allied with Qing at some point and then

Then...

Then Japan annexed Korea.

How did this even happened? There is no source about Japanese invasion of Korea anywhere except for ""well, they just annexed""

4- Korean reaction to westernisation

I can find about Qing, Ottoman, Japanese, Saudi, Zulu and Indians reaction to presence of western culture.

Qing rebelled against it and got occupied part by part. First in Opium Wars then in Boxer Uprising. Taiping rebellion was the last blow then the Qing started to dissolve and republic replaced the empire.

Ottomans first janissary and religious leaders opposed it. Ahmed III tried to get French culture and technology in Ottoman Empire and started the Tulip Period. But Patrona Halil a Janissary commander started a rebellion that evolced into religious mob uprising ( [https://tr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrona\_Halil\_%C4%B0syan%C4%B1](https://tr.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrona_Halil_%C4%B0syan%C4%B1) ) .But then Mahmud II and Abdulmejid I reformed the state but it was too late.

Japanese first ignored west with isolationism. Then opened Nanban Trade. And then with introduction of muskets ashigaru infantry beat the samurai in Boshin Warfare and empire restored. Daimyo of Satsuma tried to drag Japan into war with Korea in a debate named Seikanron. Japanese authorities rejected it and with reaction to westernization too Satsuma domain rebelled and got crushed. Then Kodoha (pro-west) and Toseiha (anti-west) factions conflicted and Kodoha won.

Sauds were exempt from westernisation in Ottoman Empire as Hijaz region (most important part of Arabia) was exempt from taxation and mufti of Mecca had some authority there. When the British arrived in WW1 they joined arms with them against Ottomans. Saudi kings tried to implement westernisation but Great Mosque Seizure happened and they abandoned it all.

British and Dutch presence in South Africa first targeted Xhosa people. Xhosas started Nongqawuse movement that involved them dlaughtering their cows, caused a famine and Fengu with British army occupied all Xhosa Kingdom. British later declared war on Zulu Kingdom and after a months of idling and losing Zulus attacked British with spear in Isandlwana and won. then later Zulus attacked Rorke's Drift but this was a defeat.

Mughals got defeated by British East India Company and sultan became imprisoned. Then Sepoy Mutiny started and Indians declsred British as illegitimate government and declared Bahadur Shah as the legitimate sultan. The mutiny started over new rifles. Company was almost defeated but Gurkhas, Punjabi Sikhs and British Imperial army arrived and wnded the rebellion. Later on until cold war era, Indian public was alienated from British and they did not adopted most of western culture.

How Korean public snd state reacted to westernisation?

But I've also heard other people say the story has basis in real island-based civilizations that were wiped out by natural disasters like volcanic eruptions in ancient history. So did Plato actually make it all up to teach a moral lesson, or was he drawing on a pre-existing myth that would have been familiar to his audience? Or does the idea of Atlantis have a completely different origin?

Another thing I've heard that I'd like to confirm is that sometime in the 19th century the concept of Atlantis being a real place became a popular part in the theosophy movement, which may explain why believing it to be real seems to be a common fixture in weird new age-y beliefs and conspiracy theories to this day. And of course, nowadays Atlantis is an extremely common idea to include in fiction, whether as central to the plot or as an offhand reference. It's in both DC and Marvel comics, Disney movies, LEGO lines, it was a fixture of fantasy stories from the pulp magazine era, etc., etc.. So where did this ancient Greek story come from, and how did it not only become so well known to be such a stock concept in all kinds of stories (even fantasy stories set in made-up worlds often have something similar in their lore that alludes to the myth, e.g. Numenor in The Lord Of The Rings, Valyria in Game Of Thrones) but also convince a lot of people that it was real and to incorporate it into their belief systems - even though it might have originally been meant to be purely fictional.",16

283,AskHistorians,t3_nz9fer,How did Pyrrhus get the resources needed to assemble a large army?,"I play a lot of strategy games and something has been bugging me for a while. It finally crystallized when I got into Imperator: Rome and noticed just how underpowered Epirus is. Unless the game is very inaccurate, Epirus had only a small fraction of the population and wealth of Rome and Carthage at the time of Pyrrhus' campaigns.

Browsing Wikipedia to get an answer, I was unsurprised to read about him having to retreat any time he faced a major army from any of the Diadochi. But he was somehow able to defeat or draw the Romans and later the Carthaginians multiple times, with no info on how he got the army other than Ptolemy lending him the elephants.

So, what gives? Was 20,000 soldiers a small army that his minor kingdom could easily raise, and the Romans and Carthaginians just couldn't be bothered to send more than a tiny fraction of their troops? Or was it a big army, and if so, how did he raise it? Was Epirus just a lot more densely populated than Italy, giving it competitive manpower and income? It would have to be hella more densely populated if this map is accurate:

Elsewhere on the internet it may be read that the entire Jewish population was to be deported to gulags, or to the Jewish Autonomous Oblast. The Wiki article alleges that ""four large camps"" had been built, and that a ""Nikolay Poliakov"", the head of a ""Deportation Commission"" (which strikes me as a suspiciously explicit name for such a commission) later told of a planned seemingly all-encompassing deportation of Jews and people of degrees of Jewish heritage. This article from the [British Medical Journal](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC139050/) claims the existence of a one million copy pamphlet titled ""Why Jews Must Be Resettled from the Industrial Regions of the Country"". Searching the web turns up several secondary sources quoting this title, but I can only see the preview of those books without the footnote regarding its origin. On the other hand, the Wiki article quotes a ""Zhores Medvedev"" as describing this plan as unfounded. Some other online sources also describe these plans as unsubstantiated rumours, build around an atmosphere of fear and antisemitism.

On the one hand, I would assume there should be good evidence of this plan (remains or documents regarding the prepared camps, whose ""vastness"" is described as breathtaking by an alleged witness from the BMJ-article, the statement by the alleged head of the respective commission, the alleged one million pamphlets). On the other hand, there seems to be a lot of skepticism about this plan's existence as far as I can see.",16

There are peaks and troughs and regional differences, but how were children on principle forced into slavery, legally and morally in Christian Europe and was there any opposition to the practice, popular or at higher levels?","Children (and adults) were sold to non-Christians (Muslims) as well in established European ports, such as Venice. So much so, that at some point of time in the X century, presumably because of opposition expressed by some concerned voices at the time, Venice had to ban the practice of sale of Christian slaves to non-Christians. However, that's when they turned to East Europe (the Slavs) for slaves on a massive scale. 

Apparently, eunuch were especially in demand and many children had to be castrated prior to being sold into slavery.

In another account somewhere else in Europe, thousands of children were misled by some monks that they would be fighting in the holy Crusade and handed over to slave merchants who shipped them to Tunisia. A small number of them ended up by mistake in Genoa, and some good people there fed them and arranged for the children to be returned home. 

There are many horror stories like this. 

In all these accounts, I'm not finding the answer to the question, where these children come from and how they ended up in slavery? Was it their poor parents selling them into slavery to settle a debt? Were they usually orphans? Or were they not familiar with the concept of slavery and in most cases they were misled and sold in slave labour? And did Christian Europe not have an issue with this, which seemed to have been happening on a large scale? And was it equally the case under the domains of the West and East churches, or was Byzantine not allowing this practice?

Was slavery ba real prospect for may children throughout Europe?

By my very simple knowledge of Roman history I’d like to say Diocletian was the turning point in this regard when the principate ended and the dominate began.

I vaguely remember reading that crossbows were a game changer and a big factor in Qin's winning streak. Is this true? If true, Why didnt the other states also effectively fight back with crossbows. Also how are crossbows used in battle? Are the crossbow units mounted on cavalry, or is it not possible to shoot from a crossbow on horseback? Were crossbows only used defensively behind a shield wall? 

How was the army split up. What percantage were the archers, the cavalry and the infantry? Were there other units? Were there war chariots? Camels existed in China, were they used? What about mules? Oxens for pulling carts? What other animals were used in chinese warfare? Were there any elephants in China (even if not used for war) 

How was Qin suddenly able to overcome every city's defenses when just before that taking a single city with high walls would sometimes take years? 

How different were chinese wars from others of the same period. Romans fought in 3 lines. But the chinese numbered over a million in some battles. Were they spread out for hundreds of miles in only 3 lines or was it much thicker? If the lines were 5 or 10 people thick, wouldnt the ones at the back have nothing to do, and wouldnt the ones at the front be boxed in by the ones behind them?

* The series portrays the dissent of the Indian justice Pal regarding the veredicts as a big failure of the process. Is this how it was perceived at the time?

* Shigenori Tōgō's sentencing is portrayed in the series the most controversial case, and one very relevant for the public opinion. Was it really a more crucial and dividing case than the others, as the mini-series implies?

* Very little attention is brought in the series to the role of the Emperor during the war. Was the real trial similarly dismissive of his responsibility, considering he was never charged after Japan's surrender?

One thing I seem to understand are tunics and hose. Tunics would have a belt on top of them for some reason and come down far. Hose were like really long socks. So what was going on in the crotch area? If all theyre wearing are tunics and hose whats keeping their genitals warm? 

Trousers or breeches also apparently existed since ancient times but I am unclear on how they worked and how popular they were (apparently unpopular among nobles to judge by all these florentine noblemen prancing about in hose and belted tunics). I do remember ye olde Osprey Publishing watercolors of Scandinavian outdoorsmen and half naked Celtic barbarians wearing what appeared to be very thick and baggy chest-high trousers held up by I guess a draw string. How did they keep their pants up? Did they fit above or below the hipbone? Did Roman legionnaires wear undies under their tunics and sandals? What happened in the early modern era and the 20th century that led to the creation of modern pants? Why did tunics disappear and get replaced by shirts that have a belt UNDER them and not over top of them?

My main point of interest is in waistlines, belts, suspenders, drawstrings etc. I have just been reading that some hose was actually attached to the tunic and therefore it was indirectly connected to the shoulders (sort of like suspenders or overalls). That sort of stuff is what I want to know more of. The physics of historical clothing, how it fit on, how it kept the elements out etc. Pretty tricky subject to read up on but obviously a lot of reenactors have seriously investigated it all for whatever their period of choice is, which is why I tried to find a reenactment subreddit before coming here.

352,AskHistorians,t3_nz5wos,[SERIOUS] Why are so many people today practicing the religions or cultural practices of their colonizers? How did it take such a strong hold?,"I have been watching some history documentaries over the past week, and something that really stood out to me was how the Spanish empire, for example, were able to basically obliterate the culture of the Natives and replace it with Christianity. People from tribes today were interviewed, and they were all wearing crosses and spoke Spanish.

I also watched some documentaries on American slavery, and was surprised to find that even there Christianity had been adopted. It showed Black churces in the South today, and I'm curious to how the religion was able to spread and take root so strongly.

Were the people drawn to the story of Jesus where he is portrayed as a innocent person? Were the Europeans super religious themselves, or was it like today's society where they use certain things from pop culture and use it to market certain things. Was religion the hot thing back then? Wondering if they used religion as an excuse to conquer because it stuck, like listening to some song today and getting on board with some cause.

382,AskHistorians,t3_nyjdti,"I'm reading the journal of an Irish convict in 1848, who presciently observes the absurdity in claiming prison is meant to reform a criminal when, to his eyes, it clearly makes criminals worse. Was this paradox obvious to others at the time? Or was ""reformation of the criminal"" just lip-service?","The book is ""Jail Journal"" by John Mitchel, an Irish nationalist who has many failings, but does offer a uniquely eloquent and educated first hand account of transportee life at the time.

Notably, he isn't in favour of attempting to reform criminals. He wants them hanged. Nonetheless, he does point out the very flaws that plague the punitive justice system to this very day. It struck me as extremely insightful and painfully obvious. Was reforming criminals really the goal? If so, surely this paradox would have been noticeable to many others besides just Mitchel...

Here is his entry, in full:

&gt; February 3rd.—-Between my cabin, and the place occupied by the convicts, are two wooden bulks, or walls, and a room or passage between those walls—yet when the men talk loud in quarrelling or argument, I often hear their abominable discourse. To-day I heard a long and angry dispute, the subject and phraseology of which I shall not commemorate—but all that comes to my ears, or eyes, of the ways of life in this place, shows me more and more clearly what a portentous evil is this transportation system. Each hulk, each mess or ward, is a normal school of unspeakable iniquity : and young boys who come out, as many surely do, not utterly desperate and incurable villains, are sure to become so very soon under such training. I hear enough to make me aware that the established etiquette amongst them (for there is a peculiar good breeding for hulks as for drawing rooms) is to cram as much brutal obscenity and stupid blasphemy into their common speech as it will hold—and that a man is respected and influential among his messmates in direct proportion to the atrocity of his language and behaviour. 
&gt; 
&gt; Gambling is common, and for large sums, four and five pounds being sometimes lost and won at a game of cards. A few of them, it seems, are able to get money, partly by stealing, partly by traffic. Those who work in the quarries and buildings earn threepence per day, of which but one penny per day is given them to spend : but there are tradesmen, and these sometimes work at their trades after hours; so that in one way or another they contrive to carry on a considerable traffic with the Bermudians, who communicate with them on the works in various ways. Many prisoners are employed constantly about the ship as boatmen, servants, and the like ; and they have ample opportunities to steal, of which they avail themselves to the fullest extent. If any of them were to discover a scruple about stealing, or decline or neglect to steal when he might, I find it would be resented as an offence against the laws and usages of the commonwealth, and punished accordingly. 
&gt; 
&gt; In short, evil is their recognised good—and the most loathsome extremities of depravity in mind and body are their summum bonum. Think of a boy of twelve or fourteen years, who has been driven by want or induced by example to commit a theft, sent to school at Bermuda for half his lifetime, in order to reform him ! But what enrages me more than all is to think of the crowd of starved Irish, old and young, who have taken sheep or poultry to keep their perishing families alive in the Famine, sent out to Bermuda to live in a style of comfort they never knew before even in their dreams, and to be initiated into mysteries and profound depths of corruption that their mother tongue has no name for. About two months before my arrival here, came out a great shipload of Irish—the harvest of the Famine special commission—from twelve years of age up to sixty. They were all about three-quarters starved, and so miserably reduced by hunger and hard- ship, that they have been dying off very fast by dysentery. 
&gt; 
&gt; As to the behaviour of these poor creatures, I learn from the commander that they have no vice in them, are neither turbulent nor dishonest, nor give any trouble at all. "" But,"" adds the commander, "" they will soon be as finished ruffians as the rest."" No doubt they will, poor fellows. He informs me that they were astonished, at first, at the luxuries provided for them—fresh beef three days in the week, and pork the other days, pea-soup, tea, excellent loaf-bread—things they had never seen before, except in shops, and which they no more knew how to use than Christophero Sly. Then they have the liberty to write home as often as they like ; and when they tell their half-starved friends how well a felon is fed, what can be more natural than that famished Honesty should be tempted to put itself in the way of being sent to so plentiful a country? This man tells me he has many prisoners in the Dromedary who have been here before, and not a few in their third term ; that he has several fathers and sons together ; and that it is not uncommon to find families who have been hulked for three or four generations. Hulking, as a profession, is as yet confined to England—that it will become a more favourite line of business there, as the poverty of the English poor shall grow more inveterate, cannot be doubted. God's mercy ! is Ireland not to be torn out of the hands of these ameliorative British statesmen until they have brought this crowning curse upon her, too ? 
&gt; 
&gt; There are now about two thousand convicts at Bermuda—about a thousand at Spike Island ; how many may be at Gibraltar and Australia, not to speak of the several depots for them in England, I know not ; but on the whole there is an immense and rapidly growing convict community distributed in all these earthly hells, maintained in much comfort, with everything handsome about them, at the cost of the hard-working and ill-fed, and even harder working and worse-fed people of England, Scotland, and Ireland. That there is a limit to all this, one may easily see. 
&gt; 
&gt; What to do, then, with all our robbers, burglars, and forgers ? Why hang them, hang them. You have no right to make the honest people support the rogues, and support them better than they, the honest people, can support themselves. You have no right to set a premium upon villainy, and put burglars and rick-burners on a permanent endowment. It is not true to say that in Bermuda (for instance) the value of their own labour supports them, because that labour is employed upon most extravagant public works, which government could not undertake at all with- out convict labour, and the wages come out of the taxes paid by the honest people ; in short, they support themselves just as seamen on board a man-of-war support themselves, and do not earn their living half so hard. The taxes keep up the “convict service,"" just as they keep up the navy and the excise men. 
&gt; 
&gt; In criminal jurisprudence, as well as in many another thing, the nineteenth century is sadly retrogressive ; and your Beccarias, and Howards, and Romillys are genuine apostles of barbarism——ultimately of cannibalism. “Reformation of the offenders” is not the reasonable object of criminal punishment, nor any part of the reasonable object, and though it were so, your jail and hulk system would be the surest way to defeat that object and make the casual offender an irreclaimable scourge of mankind. Jails ought to be places of discomfort ; the "" sanitary condition "" of miscreants ought not to be better cared for than the honest, industrious people—and for ""ventilation,"" I would ventilate the rascals in front of the county jails at the end of a rope.",41

385,AskHistorians,t3_nygxvo,Heavy calibre naval guns were rated for around a few hundred shots with relatively few replacement barrels.

I understand these are not counting every shot, but the most wear intensive shots, some of the lighter shots being counted as 0.4 or even 0.03. But considering that shells loaded to kill enemy battleships would be rated at very high wear on barrels, how sustainable was Nelson-class HMS Rodney unleashing 378 16-inch rounds on Bismarck in a single fight while the Royal Navy only had 9 reserve guns? Wouldn't the RN run out of barrels pretty quickly since just one battleship would need all 9 to replace their worn out guns?

The family then was attacked and chased out of town by the KKK.

403,AskHistorians,t3_nyrp33,What is the quota to be called a “great” in history?,"I’ve been thinking about this recently, apparently there are 38 official greats, that is to say someone with “the great” at the end of their name, eg Alfred the great or Catherine the great. I know a lot about Alfred, and aside from essentially vassalising Mercia and saving England from the Vikings, he wasn’t a conqueror, he was just a good tactician and a learned man. Compare this to William the conqueror, arguably a cooler name, but surely he should be worthy of “the great”, he conquered England. 

Some seem far more worthy of the great than others. I’m aware in Alfred’s case that he had a lot of propaganda done for him which essentially nurtured a personality cult, obviously I don’t know about every single case. 

Also it seems that aside for a few exceptions, the vast majority of “the greats” were from around 800 to 1700” with a few being dubbed the great later on. None except for Meiji ruled in the 1900s according to the Wikipedia list of “greats”. 

So what’s the criteria, how come we have no greats in the 20th century? Why are some people chosen over others, like no William the great or julius the great?",2

I want to ask this because it seems there’s been a recent surge in mainstream interest regarding the JFK assassination. I also feel like it’s proponents are beginning to present themselves in a more mature, professional fashion by scraping off the kitsch “conspiracy theory” subculture deitritus that’s built up over the last 60-ish years around it. I’m thinking in particular about recently released and respectable works like *The Devil’s Chessboard* and *JFK And The Unspeakable*. It really feels like there has been an effort to take back discussion of the JFK assassination from the weirdos and offer a compelling, realistic motivation and explanation. It isn’t just the psychotic ramblings of a disturbed mind anymore. Not for nothing there *is* a deluge of circumstantial evidence of a conspiracy surrounding the event but of course no smoking gun and therefore no satisfying resolution. Perhaps too it should be expected that there would be unexplainable details and coincidences involving the murder of the most important man in the world.

After Washington, the highest army position (Commanding General/Chief of Staff) was held by Brigadier, Major, and Lieutenant generals until Grant, who was only promoted after the Civil War. The two successors to Grant were also four-star generals but then the Army went back to being headed by Major and Lieutenant Generals until WW1. Even during WW1 era, Chiefs of Staff Tasker Bliss and Peyton March were only temporarily made a full Generals and reverted back to Major Generals at the end of their appointments as Chief of Staff.

It seems European nations had plenty of full Generals and even Field Marshals above them. I understand the US Army was smaller at the time, but during the Civil war, the Army did become very large but was still commanded by Major and Lieutenant generals. 

There is little cost to promoting someone to the rank and ""General"" without any modifiers (i.e. ""Brigadier""/""Major""/""Lieutenant"") is the obvious rank for person in charge. For example, even small police departments are generally headed by a (full) police Chief, not an Assistant Chief, Deputy Chief or something else lower and I don't know of any small organizations that decided for fairness to larger organizations they should be headed by a ""Vice President"" because they were too small to warrant a (full) ""President"".

428,AskHistorians,t3_nyey0f,"Why didn't strategies in the game ""Crusader Kings 3"" work in real life at the time?","so this question is more directed at the historians who are familiar with this game but to explain.

&amp;#x200B;

Crusader Kings 3 is a video game where the player picks a person from the time period selected in the menus, and then proceeds to look at a historically accurate map of europe at the time period, and tries to further goals, whether thats conquering entire countries and forming empires, or having massive families and dynasties, the player will play as their Heir if they have one upon their characters death, if they dont have an heir, its game over. so you're playing as the person not the nation. with all the problems that arise from that and all the rules and laws followed at the time in place, along with every other character/person in the game having their own ambitions and own goals.

&amp;#x200B;

within this, the country Ireland for example is considered the ""noob"" start, aka the one for absolute beginners because its so isolated and easy to take your time to work out how to play and respond and then conquer ireland and the rest of the UK as an Irish lord in the 9th century or later.

&amp;#x200B;

now obviously, Ireland did NOT conquer england and scotland and then somehow move on to attacking france or something. but in the game you can just fabricate claims on neighbours, press them, and raise levies, mercenaries and men-at-arm squads to take them and add them.

another example is one can play as King Harold Godwinson of England in the year 1066, the famous battle of Hastings of course. soon the player is invaded by William and also the vikings at similar to same times, an impossible situation that claims the Kings life, and title. but in the game you have enough tools available that you can actually repel both attacks and preserve Harolds lineage, and take the throne when he dies as King Magnus 

my question, as an idiot/generally ignorant person to basic logic and knowledge, was wondering.

&amp;#x200B;

why didnt this work in real life at the time? why couldnt lords just do this? just raise their armies and unite countries and have big families like that? if Crusader Kings is so historical surely its mechanics and tools available to the player would have also been available to the real people at the real time. so then obviously either A. the people at the time didnt have the information to see this power, or B. Crusader Kings 3 is taking large liberties with how things ran at the time. so if its these, what was stopping them?

444,AskHistorians,t3_nyeekw,"What makes a country an ""empire""? Is it committing ""imperialism""?

Neither is simply ruling over multiple different kingdoms/countries or ethnicities as Prussia ruled over many Polish people and large parts of Poland yet was never considered to be an ""empire"" (only when it turned into the literal German Empire). Likewise, the Kalmar Union/Denmark was as far as I know never considered to be an ""empire"" despite ruling over three different kingdoms and ethnicities.

So is it only committing colonialism then? I mean every single colonial ""empire"" was considered to be an ""empire"". They are almost synonomous with each other. Except, not every ""empire"" was colonizing. Especially when going back in history, pre-European colonialism. The Babylonians are considered to be an ""empire"", despite never committing colonization (unlike the Carthaginian Empire). So this is also not the criteria to be an ""empire"".

So, what do we have left then? Well, what about literal ""imperialism""? I mean, its literally in the word! But, imperialism accourding to Marriam Webster is:

&gt; the policy, practice, or advocacy of extending the power and dominion of a nation especially by direct territorial acquisitions or by gaining indirect control over the political or economic life of other areas

But almost all states in history conquered other people and acquired new territories, but few are considered to be ""empires"". And as for the latter half of that definition, well: The EU is extending its influence over others and gaining indirect control over other countries, sometimes even hostile by for example sanctioning Russia. Yet, nobody would call them an ""empire"", right?

But out of the gate it's clear that people in every social and professional group are being targeted; this doesn't sound like the kulak purges in Russia which were aimed, however accurately, at people who owned property as a social class.

There are incidents of workers accusing party representatives, party representatives accusing factory managers, students accusing faculty and party bureaucracy accusing other party bureaucracy. An enormous amount of factionalization happens very quickly and it seems like a coin-toss which side in any given schism is going to be accused of being part of the ""bourgeois reactionary line"" regardless of their previous social position.

465,AskHistorians,t3_ny8m3m,"Did peasant levies (conscripts) exist in medieval Europe? If so, has their presence been exaggerated?","An unusual-sounding question, but I've heard conflicting information about the usage of peasant levies in medieval European militaries. In most popular history, it's generally assumed that the average medieval grunt is, for lack of better terminology, part of a mob of peasants with pointy sticks. However, I've heard it said on this forum that conscription of peasants fell out of favor by (roughly) the time of the Crusades, and I've even heard that at least one historian thought the very concept of peasant levies was made up in the modern era as pro-conscription propaganda (that being said, I haven't looked into the sources for this claim.)

In brief, what's the deal with peasant levies? Were they a thing, and if they were, has the usage of them been exaggerated?",10

1. IIRC firearms still weren't mass manufactured. As army sizes increased, how were militaries able to continue arming their soldiers? Were firearms confiscated from the peasantry to meet the demand?

2. Did militaries 'adopt' certain firearm designs in the way that we think of today? Or were they far more loose with their equipment? 

3. Since all firearms were hand-fitted, how were firearms repaired if they were damaged? Did gunsmiths accompany armies and repair them on site?

472,AskHistorians,t3_ny6rt0,Why were people concerned about revealing Earth's position on the golden records in the Voyager space probes given the probes' low speed?,"Often in the context of discussions about the Voyager space probes people mention (but don't elaborate) that the golden records included in the craft show the position of the Earth to potential alien species finding the probes. Then they also often mention that some were opposed to this inclusion on security grounds (but again don't elaborate).

Given the low speeds of the probes, being only about 150 AU from the sun now, 50 years later, (1 light year is over 60000 AU) and the nearest star being several light years from our sun one would think that the probes' position and trajectory alone would likely make it easy to discern where it came from for any alien species advanced enough to be able to visit us.

Were those concerns just added later or were they just fringe groups similar to the ones who thought the Large Hadron Collider would destroy the universe when it was turned on or was there genuine concern from anyone that was taken seriously at the time?",10

Correct me if I'm wrong (I'm sorry if I offend anyone) but I'm also under the impression the latter is true.

Was it possible and common for people to hear code and immediately infer text from that? Or at least the characters and by noting them down one by one to get a message out?

I am sure that the technicians who actually decoded messages every day were better than others. But I also assume that the code was at some time probably also taught to the (more) general public because morse-code seemed very important at the time.

So in summary:
1. How good were ever humans in decoding morse code without any outside help (specialists as well as educated normies)? and
2. How widespread was the ability to decode it at all in the (educated) public?",3

Every performer would have their own take on the exact sequence of events and the details, which led to a lot of different variations.

But I've read that it was common to memorize Homer's versions word for word. Did these versions become definitive? When the versions we accept as ""standard"" appeared, did these variant versions of the narrative disappear? 

Brahmin scholars in India would also often memorize the entirety of important Sanskrit texts, including the epic poems attributed to Valmiki and Vyasa. These stories originally come from a similar oral tradition based around live performace, which continued into the early modern period.

What I found so far:

\- The author of a pamphlet that played a big part in inciting the murders was paid by William for several years. It is unclear whether the payments began before or after the pamphlet in question was published.

\- William refused to prosecute the murderers and in fact rewarded some of them and furthered their careers.

&amp;#x200B;

I've recently taken an interest in the history of Myanmar, Thailand and Cambodia, and I'm somewhat confused by some of the material I've found. For one, there seems to have been a very explicit idea of ethnic division between the Mon, the Bamar and the Shan (whose exonym seems to be made from their ethno-linguistic closeness to the Thai), with them seeing themselves as separate peoples and uniting around ethnic lines, rebelling against kings of other ethnicities and expulsions of Mon people into Thailand. This seems strange to me, but I have very little knowledge of this area so I'd love to learn more. Basically, I want to know if the arrival of the Shan in the 10th century and their eventual domination, as well the fights between the Kings of Ava and Pegu, created an early sense of strong ethnic conflict in the area, and if competition with the Mon and the Shan impacted Bamar culture in any tangible ways.",3

592,AskHistorians,t3_nx609t,"How accurate is the data on 19th century southern American slave living standards in ""Time on the Cross""?","In 1974, economic historians Robert Fogel and Stanley L. Engerman released the monograph ""Time on the Cross: The Economics of American Negro Slavery."" In it, they argued that early-mid 19th century southern American slavery did not match the popular perception, and that some of these perceptions were influenced by racism on part of both slavers and abolitionists. Their main points are covered in the first few pages, as paraphrased by [this public source](https://web.archive.org/web/20111220190203/http://eh.net/node/2749). The one I'm interested in is point number eight, which claims that slave living standards (life expectancy, diet, work hours, etc.) were not considerably worse than those of contemporary free American workers, and thus far above most of the planet, even in richer countries. From a free preview I've been able to spot the following statistics:

\-Life expectancy. On p. 126, the text claims that slave life expectancies at birth were only 13% lower than those of whites at about 35 years, and higher than the average in France.

\-Diet. On pages 111-114, the book claims that the average calorie consumption for a slave was 4,185, with a (by contemporary world standards) high amount of meat consumption (this was higher than a freeman's 3,741 though, obviously slaves worked harder and longer). Their charts state that slave diets were largely comparable to those of freemen, with the exception of the latter eating slightly more meat and milk. They consumed six ounces of meat and one glass of milk per day, with the rest of their diet mostly being grains and potatoes (especially corn and sweet potatoes). Furthermore, the book states that the slave diet ""was not only adequate, it actually exceeded modern (1964) recommended daily levels of the chiefr nutrients. On Average, slaves exceeded the daily recommended levels of proteins by 110 percent, calcium by 20 percent, and iron by 230 percent, and two and one half times the recommended level of vitamin C.""

\-Housing. On page 115-116, census data is quoted showing that the average slave household was 5.2, compared to freemen at 5.3. Most slaves lived in single-family households and house sharing was uncommon. The family was the core unit of slave society. While the authors admit data is fragmentary, they assert based on ""comments of observers"" that the average slave house was a cabin about 18 by 20 feet with one or two rooms, with a wooden structure, raised plank floor, and a brick or stone chimney. It states that this was comparable to free workers of the time.

\-Clothing. On pages 116-117 the book states that, based on the records of large plantations, a standard annual issue for adult males was four cotton shirts, four pairs of pants, and two pairs of shoes, while for women it was four dresses, or the material needed to make them. Hats were issued annually and blankets biannually. Socks and underwear were issued irregularly. These clothes would be supplemented by whatever the slaves made or bought themselves.

\-Work hours. On page 208, it's stated that the work year of a southern American slave was 275 days, and that during peak labor periods, they worked 75 hours per week, the same as free farmers.

Obviously these would be controversial statements. My question: after fifty years of advances in economic science and historiography, what is the general academic consensus on this point today? Note that I am not asking about the validity of any of their conclusions. I am solely concerned with the validity of their data. Not having access to the full text, and with them not really elaborating on some of their sources within the preview I *was* able to see, I couldn't begin to guess at this myself.",45

It was a fascinating telling of the Mongols and their history that shears away centuries of FUD about the Mongols and their culture, and its influence on other cultures.

One question I have after reading the book is, how did the Mongols deal with their wounds on the battlefield, given their strong taboos against touching blood? Indeed, the most noble death (at least given to some deemed ""too important"" to die in a disgraceful way) was to execute someone without spilling blood, like being crushed or drowned. (Or, as the author notes several times, rolled up in carpets and seemingly danced on/walked on to death.) 

Weatherford's book goes into a lot of detail about the engineering and battlefield tactics that the Mongols either pioneered or otherwise adopted from others that allowed them be so successful militarily, economically, socially, etc. And he describes how eager the Mongols were to adopt practices that ""just worked"" from other cultures.

I'm asking a deliberately loaded question because I'd like to get a historian's explanation of how country/folk music was positioned in the 20th century political and cultural landscape of the US.

To me it seems like country singers were either conservatively religious (the Carter Family, J. Cash, ...), or very left-leaning and anti-capitalistic (Bob Dylan...). How can this be?

More specifically about J. Cash: I like his music, a lot, but I feel uncomfortable not knowing more about the artist in a political landscape. One song he's singing against prison injustice or for the First Nations' (""Indians"") rights (in the album Bitter Tears for instance), the other he's praising General Lee and just giving off a nasty ""confederate south"" vibe...

It essentially says, ""I heard this from Khalid who heard it from 'Umar who heard it from Abbas who heard it from the prophet, peace be upon him.""

This system relies on reliability of each link in the chain and how likely that person is to have transmitted the information correctly, which is based on a judgement of the person's character.

Had this sort of character judgement as a technique to settle disputes (not just in religion but also in other affairs, e.g. trade) been around in Arabia at that time, before Islam? What was the literary and oral culture like?",24

652,AskHistorians,t3_nxcn0l,Russian Paper and Westhalian iron crash,"Hi I'm trying to find out information about **two economic crises** related to **Russian Paper** and **Westphalian Iron** that occurred in the **Late 19th Century**. These are mentioned in passing by Robert Louis Stevenson in his book ""A Footnote to History. Eight Years of Troubles in Samoa""

I have included the sentence in which he mentions it below:

""When its founder, John Cæsar Godeffroy, went bankrupt over **Russian paper** and **Westphalian iron**, his most considerable asset was found to be the South Sea business.""

FYI. John Cæsar Godeffroy (7 July 1813 – 9 February 1885) was a Hanseat trader from Hamburg who had expanded his family’s company J. C. Godeffroy &amp; Sohn’s business into the Pacific in 1855. The South Sea Business RLS refers to is the one that he established in Samoa which played a tremendous role both in the economic but also the political development of the country and perhaps even the Pacific Island region.

I have tried searching for information on both the Russian Paper Crisis and the Westphalian Iron Crisis but have not been able to find anything relevant. Anything mentioned is usually for another time period. I also tried looking at all economic crisis for the period but nothing seems to appear.

I'm sure that there have been books or papers written about these. I just want to get some details. In essence:

* What were they?
* What happened - what cause the collapse?
* What was the fall out?

I'm assuming that the Russian Paper crisis it has to do with the sale of bonds or something and the Russian currency was devalued or something which made the papers worthless.

As for the Westphalian Iron crisis I'm not sure. I know the region is known for iron mining and that some problems occurred latter in the 1928 due to industrial disputes. but I have not been able to find anything about a crisis in the late 19th Century.

Other than that I found some mention of German economic prosperity decreasing at the start of 1900 after having risen steadily in 1895-1899. There is also a mention that Rhenish Westphalian iron was sold at a loss due to the economic crisis - but this was around 1902 so it does not fit (this was in the Monthly Consular Reports of the US Dept of Commerce and Labour September-December 1903). I'm trying to locate the reports related to the period I'm interested in.

Anyway I'm hoping someone knows something about these two events and/or can point me to some resources that would have more information.

""Some puritans decided to leave their colonies to go live with the native Americans""

Other comments indicated that young puritan children who were kidnapped did not try to escape and return to their own people. This was chalked up to the natives having better quality of lives due to their millennia of experience on the land. Others equated it to the strict lifestyle of the puritans and the children enjoying the more ""free spirited"" life of the native population.

680,AskHistorians,t3_nwc23c,"Historians who specialize in early American history, where would you look for information on a house built in southern Ohio between 1804 and 1828?","For the the past nine months, I’ve been trying to confirm or deny the age of a Cincinnati, Ohio, house widely reported as built in 1804.

The facts: Although newspaper stories, county records, and the plaque on the house say 1804, I’ve only been able to date it to 1834. That’s the date on a plat commissioned by the heirs of supposed builder James C. Morris. He died intestate, as did his wife, Jane. His children then sued for the right to divide and sell the family farm. The plat includes the house, labeled as “Morris Homestead.”

The house presumably dates at least to 1828. Numerous period sources confirm that James C. Morris lived there, and he died in 1828. However, U.S. Navy records tell us that Morris was a prisoner in northern Africa—part of the crew of the USS Philadelphia—until 1805. Several family documents in a local archive confirm that the family did not come to this area until after his captivity. Furthermore, county records indicate that he almost certainly did not buy the property where the house stands until after 1814. (I’m still figuring out which deed refers to which piece of property, but he bought several large parcels in this area between 1815 and 1820. I believe the relevant deed is the one from 1817.)

The 1804 story has appeared consistently in credible outlets since at least 1925. But I can’t find any factual basis for it, and I have found a number of other half-truths and contradictions in the story as commonly told. (It’s also odd to me that the sturdy farmhouse, which is one of the oldest buildings in the county if it’s actually 217 years old, didn’t seem to attract attention from writers or historians before 1925. They certainly enjoyed reminiscing about pioneer days in the late 1800s, and it was/is a prominent part of an urban neighborhood that grew rapidly from about 1870-1910... Maybe you historians have helpful perspective on that.)

The most interesting evidence that the house could predate 1828 might be a passage in early Cincinnatian Oliver Spencer’s 1835 “Indian Captivity.” Spencer likely sold the property to Morris, and in describing his father’s 1790s frontier cabin, he mentions an “old hewed log house” then standing six feet from the site of the cabin, in a location that corresponds to that of the modern-day Morris House. If it was “old” in 1835... (I have also considered that many early settlers tore down their simple, fortified cabins relatively quickly, replacing them with more comfortable log and timber-frame homes. Could the Morris House actually be the Spencer House? Or could ""old"" in 1835, in a relatively young city, possibly have meant... 1825? Or 1817?)

Anyway, I’ve written enough. The real question is: Where, beyond the usual sources, would you look for evidence? I’ve looked at deeds (which do not mention a house—but that seems to be normal), gathered all the maps I can, scoured newspaper archives... I’ve connected with a restorationist who could date a sample from one of the bark-on joists in the cellar, which could be helpful.

I’m starting to worry we’ll never find a definitive answer. At this point, I’m thinking my best bet might be something random—a diary entry, a detail in a court case, a road report. I’ll keep looking in local archives, which have been helpful, but I’m looking for the kind of experience-based insight that can only come from a professional.

Thank you for your time! I know I’m pushing boundaries by posting this here, but after reading the rules, I think it’s an appropriate question about process.

If the Confederate Army could evade its Northern counterpart long enough, and bring about great financial burdens in doing so, eventually, the Union leadership would conclude the war ""wasn't worth it,"" so to speak. Basically, this would be a war of attrition. On the other hand, President Davis and General Lee wanted to win the war in the ""Napoleonic style."" That is, meet the Union head-on in battle, and secure decisive victories that eliminated the adversary's armies.

I see this pop up a lot in accounts of early Islamic history, with Khalid bin Waleed and Ali Ibn Abi Talib being particularly prominent examples. The circumstances of these events lead to me to take these accounts with a grain of salt. But I've also seen an example of a certain Roman general, Marcus Claudius Marcellus, who killed a Gallic chieftain in single combat. However, it seems that even contemporary Romans considered this an extremely rare and exceptional event. So was it very uncommon? Did it happen primarily in more tribal societies, such as those of the Gauls and of the Arabs? Is that why it's somewhat rare amongst more settled societies? If it did happen, what was it's purpose? Merely to raise morale? Or was it so common that if a leader didn't do it, they'd suffer a loss of face? Sorry for the long question.",8

724,AskHistorians,t3_nwyequ,Did the Nazis consider themselves socialist?,"My question is not whether the Nazis were or weren’t socialists. My question is whether they considered themselves socialists.

I’ve looked this question up but all I get is articles saying what the Nazis were or were not in practice rather than addressing what the Nazis considered themselves, and I want to know what they considered themselves. Several of those articles say that the Nazis publicly paid lip service to socialism just to attract more people, that it was branding, and imply or outright state that the Nazis did not consider themselves socialist.

But what if this was instead genuine in the sense that the Nazis thought their principles were socialist? My understanding is that the Nazis purged the more socialist elements of their own party and went after left-wing socialists—but did the Nazis view themselves as a sort of right-wing socialism, as a “purer” socialism not tainted by Bolshevism or Marxism?

I found this [republished interview on theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/sep/17/greatinterviews1)  that identifies itself as an edited interview of Hitler from 1923 by George Sylvester Viereck. I do not know anything about Viereck. Is his word credible, or would it have been in his interest to falsely portray this interview? 

Supposedly, these were some of Hitler’s words:

&gt;  “Socialism is an ancient Aryan, Germanic institution. Our German ancestors held certain lands in common. They cultivated the idea of the common weal. Marxism has no right to disguise itself as socialism. Socialism, unlike Marxism, does not repudiate private property. Unlike Marxism, it involves no negation of personality, and unlike Marxism, it is patriotic. We might have called ourselves the Liberal Party. We chose to call ourselves the National Socialists. We are not internationalists. Our socialism is national. We demand the fulfilment of the just claims of the productive classes by the state on the basis of race solidarity. To us state and race are one.”

Does this fit with Hitler’s other statements about the Nazi party, their platform, and socialism? What about other Nazis? Was a definition of socialism like Hitler’s and a similar understanding of the party platform typical to other Nazis?",0

In it they mention that during the Civil War, Caesar made a surprise crossing of the Adriatic when everyone thought it was winter (and thus extremely dangerous) but it was actually fall (dangerous but less so). 

They go on to explain that Caesar's role as Pontifex Maximus was to manage the drift in the Roman calendar which he hadn't done during the entire time he was in Gaul, thus the calendar had drifted so much it said winter but felt like fall. 

This seems like it would destroy's the average farmer's ability to farm. You would plant your crops thinking it's spring but it's actually summer, the entire planting season is out of allignment. This should lead to massive crop failure, yet nothing like this is mentioned in the series. 

Is this story of the winter crossing accurate? And if so, how did farmers cope with a misaligned calendar for a decade?

The question is inspired by Katrin Marcal's book (*Who Cooked Adam Smith's Dinner*). According to her, Adam Smith never cooked and washed his dish - his mother and cousin did it for him - and it gave him much leisure time to write. 

The question is also inspired by Heidegger's short essay on his favorite cabin in the Black Forest south of Freiburg. Heidegger thought his cabin was the perfect time for philosophy, being surrounded by forest that gave him the feeling of being back to nature. It's interesting that the said forest is, as a matter of fact, man-made, not natural.

Even if the army wasn't allied with the criminals, the cartels have far better technology and weapons than them.

Most of us here have given up hope that the situtation can ever be solved at this point, since cartels and goverment are basically the same thing now.

My question is, has something similar to this ever happened in other moment of history? If so, how did the situation get solved?",24

794,AskHistorians,t3_nw1a31,New Testament Studies-- How to find recent scholarship?,"Hello! I have, over the last six months, become very interested in the historical early christians, not as a christian myself, but as someone who studies and is fascinated with the Roman empire and hellinization as well, not to mention I find judaism quite interesting too. I am also a history teacher, currently teaching 4th grade, but next year will be teaching (so I hope) intro to western civ for 9th grade. Anyway, I am wondering where I can go and what names I can look up if i am interested in the most recent scholarship on these topics? Not to teach it, simply for my own edification.

To educate myself, I have read everything by Bart Ehrman and Elaine Pagels, for starters, as they were extremely accessible. I also read King's ""What is Gnosticism,"" Meyer's book on gonosticism, and I've got a copy of the nag hamadi scriptures so I always go and read the documents referred to in these books. I've also studied Q, using Kloppenborg's compilation, and re-read much of the gospels and paul's letters from this new perspective. I've read national geographic's book on the gospel of Judas, but am now reading DeConnick's 2008 rebuttal to it. I have also, via the great courses plus, taken a class on greek history, alexander the great, two by bart ehrman, a class on gnosticism, a class on the old testament, and am now in a class about pre christian religion. Right now I am also reading A Myth of Innocence which is beyond captivating. 

But I want to find what's recent-- these are all from over a decade ago, I feel there must be more recent books and scholarly articles, of course! 

I also am open to any other suggestions for books or lectures or articles from the past on this, of course, please suggest those too.

Essentially, in order to access the main gate or entrance to a castle, you first have to find your way through a maze of high stone walls.

This could slow down attackers and provide opportunities for defenders to attack them from above as they tried to find their way through the maze. People who were supposed to be going in and out on normal days could be guided through the maze by guards or something.

By the end of it, Japan would surrender unconditionally and Truman chose to grant Hirohito immunity and the right to remain emperor *anyway*, despite heavily insinuating prior that they would do just the opposite. In general, was there any strategically justifiable reason for him to insist on unconditional surrender? Forgive the bit of editorializing I'm going to add here, and this isn't to spark a tangent or debate about the bombings but just to frame why the answer to this question is so important, but if it *is* the case that Truman had no reasonable cause to reject a conditional surrender would that not suggest that his subsequent decision to use the atomic bombs on populated cities, regardless of any other considerations that were subsequent to the Potsdam Declaration, was monstrous and cruel?",11

During the early phases of the peace conferences at the end of World War I, one of the goals that France initially pushed for or supported was the establishment of an autonomous or independent state in the Rhineland. It is also my understanding that the French supported separatism in the region at the time.

My question is, to what degree was this actually possible? Say French demands are wholeheartedly granted and an independent Rhineland emerges. Was there enough supporters for such a state in the region to make this a feasibly functioning  country?

In Calcemacs, students and priests would prick themselves in midnight meditation rituals with a bath before bed, some sources imply it to be penance.

Merchants would also prick themselves to put blood on their walking staffs, in order to bring them luck and protect them in their travels.

In the myth of the Night Axe, it too offers cactus spines as a symbolic gift and the spines are tied to blessing or even a curse it places on you. In some legends, the spines were used to tell you a deep personal truth about yourself.

In the myth of the Tlacanexquimilli, a grass hopper like creature, would offer you cactus spines. The myth warns you that you must DENY the gift which would make the creature run away in tears and offers no reason why you should make the creature cry.

In all accounts, I don't understand what significance the spines have if any. Why is this a common theme among all of the mythology? Why specifically cactus spines?

The latter is the only type of union in the Bible that (at least roughly) reflects modern marriage.

So what was the process by which the concept of ""one man, one woman"" became the societal norm for everyone and not just the clergy?

2. Did all constitutional monarchies even have parliaments? Or could a constitutional monarchy also work by just having a constitution, no parliament, and only that constitution limiting the powers of the monarch?

3. How would constitutional monarchs commonly (ab-)use the power that they still had left to influence policy to a great(er) effect like in the days of absolute monarchy, despite the newly imposed limitations? Real examples would be cool!

Usually, trade from Europe and India to China goes through the Malacca straits and doesn’t involve going deep into the Gulf of Thailand and 100 km up the Chao Phraya River, yet how did Ayutthaya thrive as a huge trading center?

If a thriving trading center in the Kingdom of Ayutthaya were to exist, it would be either the city of Phuket as it is in the straits of Malacca.

If the city’s prosperity doesn’t rely on it being on an important maritime route, what products were sold there that made the city so attractive to traders?

Balancing weights on the head is a very efficient way to carry something, and is used by many cultures around the world. My immediate thought would be that a traveller's multi-use cooking vessel, if small and light enough, might be least cumbersome when worn on the head rather than in a pack.

Shu-Han, meanwhile, had no real claim to the throne beyond a (supposed) decree against Cao Cao and an unproven familial link to the Liu clan--claims which were presumably extinguished when Liu Shan surrendered. Moreover, the same sources that heroise Shu (The Romance of the Three Kingdoms, most obviously) assert that Han had, in fact, already lost the heavenly mandate. Why, then, by the time of the Ming dynasty, was Shu-Han held in such high regard (and indeed often asserted the real precursors to later dynasties)?",11

926,AskHistorians,t3_nu7c4e,Why did nearly all of the world's civilisations emerge so soon after each other,"Humans have been around for 200,000 years. The world's first civilisation, Mesopotamia, emerged just around 12,000 years ago. I imagine there is no necessary period of time it takes for a civilisation to emerge from the emergence of humanity. Mesopotamia took around 188,000 years to emerge after humans first appeared, but I imagine that was due to different contingent chance events or circumstances that were specific to it. I imagine if things had been slightly different, it could have taken 250,000 years, or 150,000 etc. On the timeline from humans emerging up until the present day, civilisation has only been around for a small proportion of that time - 12,000/200,000, so you could easily imagine the first civilisation emerging much sooner or much later - maybe in 40,000BC, or maybe later than the present day. Why is it then that almost all world civilisations emerged not long after Mesopotamia emerged (not long relative to the 200,000 years we have been around for). Apart from a small number of small remote tribes, there are civilisations everywhere that have their roots from a long time ago, not that long after Mesopotamia emerged, all with their roots within just some thousand of years after Mesopatamia emerged. Why is this? It might make sense that this is because civilisation spread from region to region, but the only problem with this is that my understanding is that in most instances of different peoples meeting, some sort of civilisation already existed amongst both peoples - the native Americans had civilisations, as did the Africans and south Americans when europeans arrived. Wouldn't this all also explain why some civilisations are more advanced than others. If one emerged after 188,000 years and one after 190,000 years, that 2000 years can have a big effect on advancement due to the exponential nature of advancement, but the 2000 year gap can just be explained by minor contingent chance events or circumstances rather than broad general fundamental differences since it's only a small fraction of the total time since humans first emerged.",2928

So I'm also quite open to learning about how things were done in East Asia more broadly, especially in a sporting context.

Did any people in the above regions and time care about the specificity of small time periods? Or was everything schedule to the hour, as much as that might change per season? Would our modern obsession with precise schedules be 100% alien to these peoples, or merely familiar if not unusual?

Especially considering how the communion (and what is being eaten/remembered - depending on the confession) has different implications in the Lutheran or Reformed confession than in the Catholic confession (very boiled down):

Catholic - through a performative act the bread turns into the literal body of Jesus Christ (who is - according to the Catholic Church - among other things human) while the wine turns into his blood. 
Lutheran - through a performative act Jesus Christ is present during the celebration of the communion. 
Reformed - the act of communion is meant to be an act of rememberance of the last supper (Jesus Christ is in no way present while the communion is celebrated). 

Considering all this I'd expect there to be a discussion of some sort or an accusation regarding the Catholic communion being cannibalistic from some Lutheran or Reformed theologians.",4

* Base of the trigger guard has been whittled down for use of a high grip
* Trigger is a long type with 3.5 lb. trigger pull
* Magazine well has been widened for ease in feeding a new magazine

I was wondering if you could introduce me some books and the right order of reading them.

Thank you so much!",3

966,AskHistorians,t3_nv3sca,"How popular was the Nazi Party among the German populace leading up to, and during World War Two?","Hi there!

This question was sparked by a discussion with a friend. I claimed the Nazis were popular during WW2, while my friend claimed the opposite. I now realize I don't have anything substantive to back this claim, while my friend just has anecdotes. It certainly seems like an important question! (And a hard one to answer.)

I tried looking around for papers on this topic but couldn't find exactly what I was looking for. I am interested in the German public support for the Nazis post-enabling act, so the election results from 1932 aren't really what I am after. 

My line of thinking is that the massive propaganda efforts, sense of nationalism and patriotism put forth by the Nazis, creation of a scapegoat (in the Jewish people), and a general ""spirit"" of the time associated with the Nazis would have contributed to popularity for the Nazis, but again I don't know if this is actually the case. And obviously, metrics you might use in a free and open society like ""party membership"" are probably basically useless in a totalitarian regime, so a clever way around this problem is needed.

The one thing I did find was [this paper](https://www.pnas.org/content/112/26/7931) that claims anti-semitism among Germans educated during the Nazi reign is significantly higher than other age cohorts - suggesting Nazi propaganda can be effective. I would imagine there is a correlation between anti-semitism in Germany at the time and Nazi support, but this doesn't seem conclusive for my question either - since the youth don't represent the general population, and the correlation might not even hold.

Any insight would be very much appreciated!",5
967,AskHistorians,t3_nvfr4d,Is there any historical connection between white gun clubs and black voter suppression in the U.S.?,"I was reading ""Union"" by Colin Woodward, and he mentioned that in 1876, there was a campaign of terrorism organized by ex-confederate general Martin Gary in South Carolina in order to supress black voting organized through a series of what he called ""rifle clubs."" 

I know the NRA had been founded 5 years earlier, has a large base in the South and has backed very conservative candidates and organizations who critics have been accused of trying to suppress the vote of black people. Is this just a linguistic coincidence that Gen. Gary decided to call his terror cells ""rifle clubs"" or is there a connection between white gun-owner clubs and voter suppression? I know that for much of the 20th century the NRA was apolitical and was largely a sporting organization, only turning into a right-wing political organization in 1977, but I don't know much about it in the 19th century.

969,AskHistorians,t3_nvfmfs,origins of a English Aristocratic Family wealth,"hi, I'm trying to understand more about the origins of wealth of an English aristocratic family -- to be specific the marquess of Hertford the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, so we're  talking about mid 18th c. - mid 19th c. 

I understand they held many royal and political offices, but couldn't find material concerning their property / land. I think it should be mostly in Ireland as both the 1st and 2nd held high offices there, but perhaps other areas in the growing empire too?   
some ideas where to look for such information?

970,AskHistorians,t3_nv4tyr,Why was Burma so successful at war in the past?,"Burma managed to create an empire over 1.5 - 1.6 million km2 in the late 16th century under the rule of King Bayinnaung that covered all the areas of modern day Myanmar, Thailand, and Laos. It was the largest empire in Southeast Asia by landmass. Although it only lasted for about 20 years due to overextension, Nanda Bayin’s incompetence, and King Naresuan’s Siamese rebellion against the Burmese, it was a pretty impressive achievement.

In the 18th century, Burma, under the leadership of King Hsinbyushin sacked Ayutthaya and ended the Siamese kingdom in the Burmese-Siamese of 1765-1767. While most of their army was in Siam, the Chinese invaded. Using less men, they managed to defeat the Chinese. Unfortunately for the Burmese, King Taksin used the Burmese absence to reclaim all of Siam and repel another Burmese invasion. Despite this setback, it was impressive that Burma defeated China in the Sino-Burmese war with much fewer troops.

Why was it that Burma was so good at war?

978,AskHistorians,t3_nv96dy,Historical Examples of Ideology Impacting Sciences?,"Hello! While doing research for a tabletop RPG set in a darkly humorous dystopian society, I stumbled across a bit of history I had forgotten: How Soviets in the late 1920s denied natural selection was real and instead went for a version of Lamarckian ""learned evolution"" because that fit their ideology better.  

*Do y'all know of any books, documentaries, sites, or just examples of ideology impacting science or anything similar?* (For this, I'd combine hard sciences and social sciences.) I believe China's Great Leap Forward in the late 1950s/early 1960s had this problem as well--their ideology demanded positive reports, so people lied about how much food was being harvested. (I think they also exported grain during the famine to save face in the international community.)

998,AskHistorians,t3_nuou95,The CCP's official narrative on Cambodia's Khmer Rouge period.,"I have been reading into both Chinese and Cambodian history. I am currently trying to understand where and how the CCP's historical narratives differ with other countries' published history books. As a result, I have become curious about this specific subject.  I have researched as best I can, but I am limited by language (in)ability and lack of mainland-published books where I am located. If you are able to provide a source to any information you provide I would be very grateful.

&amp;#x200B;

My understanding is that the CCP has recognised that there were many deaths, but I cannot find out whether they:  


&gt;A: Recognise the government of the time's financing of the KR (as many other countries do)  
B: Recognise that what occurred was explicitly a genocide enacted by Cambodian government of the time.

Could anyone with a bit of  knowledge (not just machine-translating Baidu pages) please tell me how far this is available as information in the mainland? Alternatively, if anyone already well-versed in this area could provide examples of officials or public figures speaking on this history, I would be very interested in this.
