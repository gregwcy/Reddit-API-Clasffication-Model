This post is for new panelist recruitment! The previous one is [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/hwnhe2/askscience_panel_of_scientists_xxiii/).

The panel is an informal group of Redditors who are **either professional scientists or those in training to become so**. All panelists have at least a graduate-level familiarity within their declared field of expertise and answer questions from related areas of study. A panelist's expertise is summarized in a color-coded AskScience flair.

Membership in the panel comes with access to a panelist subreddit. It is a place for panelists to interact with each other, voice concerns to the moderators, and where the moderators make announcements to the whole panel. It's a good place to network with people who share your interests!

\-------------------

**You are eligible to join the panel if you:**

* Are studying for at least an MSc. or equivalent degree in the sciences, AND,
* Are able to communicate your knowledge of your field at a level accessible to various audiences.

\-------------------

**Instructions for formatting your panelist application:**

* Choose exactly one general field from the side-bar (Physics, Engineering, Social Sciences, etc.).
* State your specific field in one word or phrase (Neuropathology, Quantum Chemistry, etc.)
* Succinctly describe your particular area of research in a few words (carbon nanotube dielectric properties, myelin sheath degradation in Parkinsons patients, etc.)
* Give us a brief synopsis of your education: are you a research scientist for three decades, or a first-year Ph.D. student?
* Provide links to comments you've made in AskScience which you feel are indicative of your scholarship.  Applications will not be approved without several comments made in /r/AskScience itself.

\-------------------

Ideally, these comments should clearly indicate your fluency in the fundamentals of your discipline as well as your expertise. We favor comments that contain citations so we can assess its correctness without specific domain knowledge.

Here's an example application:

`Username: /u/foretopsail`

`General field: Anthropology`

`Specific field: Maritime Archaeology`

`Particular areas of research include historical archaeology, archaeometry, and ship construction.`

`Education: MA in archaeology, researcher for several years.`

`Comments: 1, 2, 3, 4.`

Please do not give us personally identifiable information and please follow the template. We're not going to do real-life background checks - we're just asking for reddit's best behavior. However, several moderators are tasked with monitoring panelist activity, and your credentials will be checked against the academic content of your posts on a continuing basis.

You can submit your application by replying to this post.",267

I don't mean that trivially, I just mean if the speed of orbit is sqrt(GM/r) and spacetime geometry breaks down near a blackhole. Should one not also be able to orbit within the ISCO as long as you are going a bit faster than sqrt(GM/r)? So as you descend you have to keep supplying energy to increase your orbital speed. 

Obviously at some point you can't go any faster. But I don't see how once you pass below the ISCO (in a spaceship) you can't keep orbiting until you start reaching relativistic speeds.",23

51,askscience,t3_nyx061,Why does stalling occur in aeroplanes?," 

I understand that an aeroplane's wings generate lift by making the air travel a greater distance on top than on the bottom in the same amount of time, effectively increasing air velocity on the top, making for a lower pressure relative to the air pressure on the bottom.

I also know that at too high an angle of attack coupled with too low an airspeed, the air separates from the top surface of the wing.

Part of me understand that if there is no airflow, and therefore no faster airflow and lower pressure, on the top of the wing, lift will decrease. However, at the same time, if the plane is moving forward and the air is failing to make contact/follow the top surface, would that not in effect be creating sort of a vacuum would be at an even lower pressure than if there was fast airflow? Would that not in itself create more lift?

I addition, I know that gold balls aren't smooth because a smooth surface would cause the airflow to not follow the surface around the ball far enough back. This results in the trailing-side of the ball having a very low pressure which greater accentuates the force acting against the direction of the ball. Would this not apply to an aeroplane's wings, where the top of the wing is analogous to the trailing-side of a smooth golf ball?

So this comes from a problem I had to solve a few weeks ago, and although successful, it's still stuck in my craw because to me, as of now, it's a problem with no obvious source and seems contradictory to me.

&amp;nbsp;

As I understand them, slugs are highly dependent on remaining in a moist environment and primarily eat plant material from living plants..

So, from a wants &amp; needs perspective, it seems like the dry floor &amp; walls of a wooden or concrete porch would not just be less than ideal, but actually the opposite of the sort of area they'd want to congregate in.

On top of this, slugs are (obviously) very, very slow-moving creatures, so it seems even more contradictory to me that such an inefficient traveler would not be extra cautious to not waste time traveling to &amp; wiggling around on what is, to them, effectively a desert.

Problem is that this simply does not apply to the universe. The total energy of the universe is going down.

Imagine a photon flying through space. As it flies for millions of years, being affected by the expansion of space between, you will see it eventually arrive at your detector with a large redshift.

I also know that declarative and procedural memory differ in certain ways, so I was wondering if the forgetting curve and spaced repetition still apply for procedural.

&amp;#x200B;

The reason I'm curious is because I'm learning to drive, and I have two choices as to how I can split the professional lessons I get. I don't have my own car or any friends that will lend me their car, so the only practice I can really do is with the driving instructor's car. I have to wait a period of 8 months until I can take the road test. There are 10 lessons or sessions I can practice in the car in total.

Option 1: I take some or 5 of the lessons now, applying the model of spaced repetition for a month, something like: day 1, day 3, day 7, day 14, day 28. But then I would have to wait until next May (when my classes end, since I really need to focus on them this year), which is 10 months later, before I take the other 5 lessons and then do my road test.

Option 2: I take all 10 lessons in a similar spaced repetition manner starting next May, and then take the road test after that.

&amp;#x200B;

I think its probably better to go with Option 2, only because there's a 10 month period where I can't do any driving with Option 1, and I'm worried that if the forgetting curve for procedural memory is pretty similar to declarative, then I'd basically be starting over if I took the other half of the lessons 10 months later. It just feels weird to not practice at all until then. Maybe if I could practice with my own car once every month then Option 1 would be viable.

I know this seems a bit overkill, but even if it is, I think it would be interesting to find an answer anyways. Thanks for any help provided!",7

95,askscience,t3_nwj2li,"Question about fractals, particularly the Sierpiński triangle, the chaos game and what happens when we use the same rules but with 4 corners. why am I getting these results?"," 

Yesterday i learned about the chaos game. To the the thing in real life, when i grew tired of drawing and measuring points in paper and rolling a die, i programmed it on python.

then i asked myself what would happen if i tried the same thing with 4 ""corners"" instead of 3. keep in mind, the corners were still placed randomly, never creating a perfect square, just a **quadrilateral.**

and the fractal pattern was still there. although it had like ""noise"" on some triangular shaped areas, getting just random points on those.

then i checked the wikipedia page on chaos game [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos\_game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chaos_game) and it said there that if you try to use the same rules from the triangle but for a perfect square (or a normal square, i guess they are always perfect), it just creates random noise, no pattern appears.

i tried it with a third program and yes, if the four corners are situated at the beggining NOT at random but forming a true square, you get nothing.

So my question is...why is it that when you do it with 4 corners but not in a perfect square shape, the pattern appears but when its regular, the pattern does not appear? is there a specific point of ""regularity"" when the pattern dissapears? and also, i've noticed that when the pattern appears, there is a triangular area where points are random noise. why is it triangular? and does its area/shape/placement have some relation to the ""triangle"" that it could be if there were only 3 points?

ill add access to the three programs in python if you want to try them for yourselves or read the code

110,askscience,t3_nvtfjg,Is it possible to create nuclear fuel as a form of energy storage?,"As I understand it, one of the main problems with renewable energy like solar power is that it needs to be spent as it is produced. Storing the produced energy would solve the problem, but while batteries are improving, they can't store energy for long periods of time. Other ways to store energy like pumping water or compressing air can't store it for long either. Heating gravel/water/chemicals and storing them underground could provide long-term storage, but building the infrastructure would cost a lot.  
Uranium is a dense energy source, and we can use it as fuel in nuclear power plants. Googling around, I can't find mention of trying to use it to store energy. I imagine it could be done by transmutation of already heavy elements, or even of radioactive waste, effectively recycling it.

Since light takes time to travel from distant points, we can't know for certain where a distant object B was at a point of time when closer object A was at that same point of time. The way I see it is that the map of galaxy/universe would be best represented like an animated sonar, where it begins with our solar system as the starting point (hope that makes sense).

Can somebody please explain why there isn't more activity around developing a live attenuated vaccine based on the actual SARS-CoV-2 virus. There is only one such vaccine in development at this time (Codagenix) as far as I know.

The way I see it live attenuated vaccines provide the closest thing to natural immunity because they use a weakened form of the same virus to create a real infection. Isn't it preferable to mimic the body's natural immune response as close as possible?

Also I understand that the immune response with live attenuated vaccines is very robust, creating both mucosal and systemic antibodies and T-cell response and typically lasts for the rest of your life. (I'm not educated in the medical field so I might have some of this wrong.) I understand that all the common vaccines that everyone gets are live attenuated vaccines such as measles, mumps, rubella, polio, flu.

About the Cancer patients, the specialists where strongly against the goverment position, saying that covid-19 might be the final drop on a Cancer Patient's life, leading them to death. It's a risk. 

Not only my country, but from what I see, people around the world are not considering Cancer Patients as a risk group. At least not strongly saying they are a risk group.

The only two things that come to my mind are: 1 - people think that: considering the fact cancer that cancer has a high cause for death in the advanced cases, they conclue that in those cenarios ""He has cancer, he is aldery dead. It's not Covid who will kills him""; 2 - people think that cancer patients, who are only in the initial stages, don't deserve vaccines since the risky of death is low.

I disagree with both points I pointed out in ""1"" and ""2"". 1 seems not logical since, covid might be the ""imediate""/""final"" factor for their death, and 2 seems fair but ignores that it might depend on the concrete case (Let's not treat melanoma as pancreas cancer). But even it I accepted these points, shouln't we all agree that people under chemotherapy are a risky group?

There are scientific factors that make Cancer Patients less a risk group than obesity for the Covid-19? Or in any way, a non-risk group in general for Covid-19?

My question is, could the act of recording the information in the computer have interfered with the experiment, causing the collapsing of the particle itself rather than the atom?

I'm Kofi Asante, the head of strategy and business development at aerospace startup Elroy Air. [Elroy Air's mission](https://youtu.be/_V3oD7u5V6w) is to improve the quality of life around the world by expanding the reach of express logistics: We're currently building an autonomous vertical take-off and landing system that can deliver 300 pounds of cargo over a 300-mile range. While at Elroy Air, I've helped develop strategic partnerships with NASA, World Economic Forum, Air Force, Embraer, and many Fortune 500 corporations.

Prior to being here, I was a part of Uber's Advanced technology strategy group team that launched Uber freight. During my time at Uber freight, I built an Uber entity that I named ""[Powerloop](https://youtu.be/Uyr8WSJoLdg),"" which decreases wait time for drivers and enables high utilization for autonomous trucks. The division is now expanding nationwide, enabling drivers to seamlessly ""loop"" to their next load using their ""power"" unit. The program has helped thousands of drivers maximize their workday and come home early to their families all at the same time.

I currently serve as a venture partner and board member at FVLCRUM Private Equity Funds. I'm also a Venture Fund Advisor to Rackhouse Ventures and a board member at the Tufts Entrepreneurship Center. My ventures both at Uber and Elroy Air have been featured in the Wallstreet Journal, PBS, Techcrunch, Forbes, and Business Insider.

For that reason, I was told that death by hanging was quite immediate. 
However, I have only heard that version once, other than that I usually hear people saying that being hung would just lead to a death by asphyxiation.

So, I followed the white rabbit on a thought train concerning this.

[The map~](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Western_Interior_Seaway)

This ocean existed because of extremely warm climates that melted the poles to the point that the Arctic Ocean spilled over the continent.

My question is, at current (grim) rates of global warming from fossil fuel emissions; along with whatever else might be contributing, would it be possible that humanity would see the resurgence of this ancient sea? Or would it likely remain too slow of a process?

My question is, is it really true that anything is possible?

Think of the silliest scenario you can think of and according to the multiverse theory (the one from scifi) there is a universe where this scenario has played out.

266,askscience,t3_noobeb,Why is feed conversion (FCR) for insects sometimes expressed as dry weight of feed over fresh weight of insects?,"So i'm reading a lot of literature right now about feed conversions of insects.

Basically 3 ways of calculating FCR's are being used in research on insects.

- Fresh weight on fresh weight
- Dry weight on dry weight
- Dry weight on wet weight

(FCR's or feed conversion ratio's are used to indicate how much feed an animal needs to produce meat. This is done by dividing mass of feed given by mass gain (live weight) of the animal. I.e. a cow for beef production would have an FCR of about 8-10, pigs 3-5, chicken 2-3)

I understand the reasoning of the first two, and why someone could have a preference of one or the other. The last one however troubles me. Why would you ever calculate the feed conversion with dry weight of feed and wet weight of insects? The only reason i see why this might be beneficial is to publish a lower FCR, and give some kind of ""wow-effect"" for people not going deeper into how the FCR was calculated.

The opposite would even make more sense, since insects are always (in my experience) dried for human consumption. Neglecting the moisture content completely neglects the importance of wet feed and water in the feed in general. As far as i know, FCR of regular meat production is never calculated this way.

I realise this is a pretty specific question in a field with not that much research, but i'm hoping for the best.

The video was well made and the results were pretty clear cut, the vehicle *could* move downwind faster than the wind. It's an interesting video, and I generally trust Veritasium to be a reliable source of information, but something seemed off in his attempt to explain the mechanics behind this machine.

He first makes references to sailboats being capable of moving faster than the wind by moving at an angle rather than downwind and taking advantage of lift. However in his attempt to translate that to the vehicle he brings up the idea that the props are actually a fan, which when spun by gearing and the wheels in turn slows down the air behind the fan blades thus speeding up the vehicle.

This seems counterintuitive to me, as the rolling wheels which are moving the vehicle forward is also driving the fan; this leaves no apparent cause for the rolling of the wheels in the first place. 

Is the cause and effect being reversed? But in that case how is it moving downwind faster? Any other possible explanations?

so i understand DFG is the process where w1,w2 are input, and w3 is the output, where w3=w1-w2.

now, the [energy diagram](https://ars.els-cdn.com/content/image/3-s2.0-B9780128110027000102-f01-03-9780128110027.gif) shows w1 getting absorbed and w2 and w3 being emitted.

wouldn't that mean that the output should be both w3 AND w2? and why is w2 a required input here?

is the w2 input supposed to cancel out the emission of w2 via destructive interference?

that'd be my reflexive guess but i'm not seeing any mention of such interference and in [this lecture](https://youtu.be/jbzx-4L4W1s?t=870)  the w2 emission in the energy diagram has (amplified) next to it which  would be the opposite of destructive interference, if anything. so i'm missing something important here.

350,askscience,t3_nk570c,"I don't understand why nuclear fusion isn't energy-neutral. As in, the mass defect is identical to the increase in binding energy required for the Helium nucleus, so, shouldn't that just be where the mass defect energy ""goes""? Hydrogen bombs work, though, so, I know I'm missing something.","So, I understand the idea of conservation of mass/energy, and that if you converted even a very small amount of matter into pure energy, it converts to a surprisingly large amount of energy.

Thus, why nuclear fusion creates a whole bunch of energy, that, there is this discrepancy in mass, called the ""mass defect"" between the total mass of the two constituent molecules (two deuterium molecules, let's say, in this case), that get combined to form a single Helium molecule, and, that amount of mass that ""vanished"" during the fusion, can't literally just vanish altogether, it has to either become energy, or go somewhere or do something (law of conservation of matter/energy etc), and, thus we get the energy-output of the extremely energy-outputting event that is nuclear fusion (well, at least very energy-outputting when it comes to the fusion of lightweight elements, anyway.  I know it gets more complicated once you're dealing with elements heavier than Iron and all that, but I digress).

Anyway, but the thing that confused me is, it seems like the binding energy for the Helium nucleus that gets formed by the two dueterons is larger than the total binding energy that the two deuterons had (prior to fusing) by EXACTLY the same amount as the energy you'd get from the amount of matter of their mass defect getting turned into pure energy, in terms of their total combined mass vs the mass of the Helium nucleus that they become.

So, shouldn't it just be an exactly, flawlessly energy-neutral event, then?

Like, if that amount of energy, that the mass defect would've put out, when that amount of mass gets converted into energy, is EXACTLY the amount of energy that is required for the higher binding energy needed to the Helium nucleus compared to 2x the binding energy of the deuterium nuclei, then, shouldn't that just be where that mass defect energy ""goes"", thus meaning no energy output to the outside world, when deuterium/helium fusion occurs?

I mean, I know that clearly I'm missing something here, since, of course, we know for a fact that hydrogen bombs (among other fusion-related things) *do* work, and *are* extremely exothermic and so on, thus the gigantic explosions and fireballs and so on...

Anyway, yea, so, I know I'm missing something here, as far as how this actually works, but, I'm not sure what it is.",65

Also, there were some tidbits that sparked some extra questions in me. So, I'm looking for someone knowledgable in this area to please clarify my questions as I'm not from a Science background.

1) Let's take a simple example of accidents. We know how many people died due to motor vehicle accidents, as its easy to attribute the cause of a death to particular accident. But, how can we attribute deaths or '*extra*' deaths to something like air pollution? 

2) Poorer countries with bad air quality also have worst healthcare systems, more poverty and other such factors. How can air pollution be attributed as a '*causal*' factor to additional deaths, and not just a '*correlated*' factor?

3) From the article linked above, this is a specific statement that evoked my interest. ""*The link between air pollution and cardiovascular disease, as well as respiratory diseases, is well established. It causes damage to the blood vessels through increased oxidative stress, which then leads to increases in blood pressure, diabetes, stroke, heart attacks and heart failure.""*. Can someone please explain to me how this link was  established epidemologically? Is this observed in humans or is this a link established via animal models? If in humans, I'm curious on what sort of studies and how were they designed to infer such a link.

4) Another interesting statement from the article above *""When they looked at individual countries, the researchers found that air pollution caused an excess death rate of 154 per 100,000 in Germany (a reduction of 2.4 years in life expectancy), 136 in Italy (reduction in life expectancy of 1.9 years), 150 in Poland (reduction in life expectancy of 2.8 years), 98 in the UK (reduction in life expectancy of 1.5 years), and 105 in France (reduction in life expectancy of 1.6 years).""* I'm guessing extra deaths or reduction in life expectancy are interchangable.

2. If i could get some explanation for how these temperature sensitive symmetries relate to Noether's theorem that'd be the cherry on top.   
I know in a general sense that physical symmetries correlate to specific conservation laws (or the conservation is the expression of the symmetry? I'm not sure what's the correct way to parse this). so does that mean that above the electroweak symmetry temperature there was some property that was conserved that is no longer a conserved property in our colder reality? if so, I'd love to know what it is if it's articulable.

390,askscience,t3_ni97db,Barr Effect in binary star systems: what does the longitude of periastron being be between 0 and 90 degrees actually say about orientation of these binary systems?," I was answering a question about the Barr Effect on another sub, and I realized I can't conceptualize what the effect translates to for us as observers. I'll link the original post in a reply.

My understanding so far is that the Barr Effect was an observation that the longitude of periastron in spectroscopic binary systems was biased to be between 0-90 degrees.

I understand literally what it is, I think: the angle in the direction of motion between the ascending node and the point where the star in question is closest to the focus is biased to be between 0-90, but what does that translate to from our view point?

I was originally thinking it meant that the periastron of spectroscopically observed binary systems was biased to be further away from us, but I'm really not sure now.  


My current explanation that I'm not sure is correct:

Since the Barr Effect is that most commonly observed angles are 0°-90°, it means that the point at which the stars are closest to each other tends to be *further* away from us, and also has a bias to be further away in one quarter of the orbit (rather than one half). The angle is defined in relation to the motion of travel, so 90° isn't the same as 270°.

Picture a clock that you're looking at directly. Between the 12 and the 3 is 0-90°. Now tilt that clock away from you so that the 12 is further away than the 6.

The Barr Effect says that the part where the stars are closest to the focus is likely to be in that 12- to 3-o'clock range.",6

Hi, Reddit! I'm [Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh](https://draimee.org/about), a fertility specialist with my own practice in the San Francisco Bay Area. I specialize in IVF and have vast experience helping women over 35 realize their dreams of becoming a mother.

I graduated from UCLA School of Medicine and completed my residency in Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology at Harvard Medical School. I also completed a fellowship in Reproductive Endocrinology &amp; Infertility and hold a Master's in Public Health Management and Policy from the University of Michigan.

A large part of my public health mission is to educate people about their fertility potential and remove the veil of mystery surrounding reproductive medicine and technologies. In the nearly 20 years since I completed my medical training in 2001, I've become well-known for my innovative approach to fertility care that begins with diagnosis before treatment. I've met many women in their 30s and 40s who have struggled with their fertility and wished they had known more about it when they were younger. In 2012, a patient inspired me to launch The Egg Whisperer, a three-step plan for fertility testing, consultation, and tracking. Then in 2014, I extended my mission to help educate and empower young people in their 20s and 30s about their fertility and better plan for their future families by starting her now well-known ""[Egg Freezing Parties](https://eggfreezingparty.com/)"" in San Francisco.

AMA!","Hi Reddit, my name is Phoebe Stubblefield! I am a forensic anthropologist, a research assistant scientist and interim director of the C. A. Pound Human Identification Lab at the University of Florida. During the centennial of the Tulsa Race Massacre, I will continue to excavate with the Physical Investigation Team at the Oaklawn Cemetery in Tulsa, Oklahoma to identify victims from the violence in 1921.

I'm here to answer your questions about the intersection of cultural anthropology with forensic sciences and our work in uncovering some of the history behind the Tulsa Race Massacre, a devastating attack on what was once known as Tulsa's thriving Black Community.

[Proof!](https://twitter.com/UFExplore/status/1392870695516790786?s=20)

My research interests at the University of Florida are:

+ Human skeletal variation
+ Human identification
+ Paleopathology
+ Forensic anthropology

More about me: In 2002, I received my Ph.D. in Anthropology from the University of Florida where I was the last graduate student of Dr. William R. Maples, founder of the C.A. Pound Human ID Lab. As an associate professor at the University of North Dakota for 12 years, I directed the Forensic Science Program, created a trace evidence teaching laboratory and helped undergraduate students learn more about careers in forensic science. I have also served as forensic consultant for the North Dakota State Historical Society, the North Dakota Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and with different medical examiner
districts throughout Florida.

Some like the Phelsuma day geckos are expected residents of the region as they also exist in nearby places like Madagascar and the Seychelles, but many others are very, very weird. To wit:

* The sadly extinct Cylindraspis tortoises are thought to have originated not in Madagascar, but in mainland Africa, and island-hopped the many volcanic islands produced until humans came along and killed them.

* The Mascarenes are presently home to about 3 species of Nactus geckos. Aside from there, all other Nactus geckos are found in Australia, New Guinea, and similar islands.

* The Leiolopisma skinks have 1 extant species and 3 extinct species on the Mascarenes. The only other Leiolopisma skink is one from Fiji, an entire ocean away (and also a dubious one from New Zealand, also an entire ocean away).

* The dodo and solitaire's closest cousin is the Nicobar pigeon, a bird found in the eastern Indian and west Pacific oceans.

* The extinct Mauritius starling (and probably its relatives) is thought to be closely related to the physically quite similar Bali myna, which is only found in Indonesia.

So how did the Mascarenes come to be dominated by all these animal groups from random portions of the world, as opposed to simply those from the nearby Madagascar and Seychelles islands?

451,askscience,t3_nefzwy,AskScience AMA Series: We're the scientists who figured out cutting methane emissions can avoid 0.3°C of global warming by 2045. Ask us anything!,"Hi everybody

We are the scientists behind a recent UN report on the impacts of methane emissions on climate change around the world. This report is called the Global Methane Assessment and you can download the whole thing [here](https://www.ccacoalition.org/en/resources/global-methane-assessment-full-report).

Here are the headline findings:

The Global Methane Assessment shows that human-caused methane emissions can be reduced by up to 45 per cent this decade. Such reductions would avoid nearly 0.3°C of global warming by 2045 and would be consistent with keeping the Paris Climate Agreement's goal to limit global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius (1.5˚C) within reach.

Because methane is a key ingredient in the formation of ground-level ozone (smog), a powerful climate forcer and dangerous air pollutant, a 45 per cent reduction would prevent 260 000 premature deaths, 775 000 asthma-related hospital visits, 73 billion hours of lost labour from extreme heat, and 25 million tonnes of crop losses annually.

We are:

+ Johan Kuylenstierna - Research Leader at the Stockholm Environment Institute

456,askscience,t3_nfj4fq,How is a Quartz Crystal both transparent and piezoelectric?,"As many of you will know, quartz crystals have a unique ability to produce an electrical reaction when pressure, heat or a charge is applied. This phenomenon is referred to as piezoelectric. This is the basis for how quartz watches work and is why these watches are both very inexpensive and accurate. 


I was wondering though, why quartz crystals are also commonly transparent. My understanding was that transparent materials are typical good insulators because they do not have available electrons to readily interacts with photons or transmit electrical charges. Conversely, this is why metals are not ever transparent. 


Can someone help me understand the nature of a quartz Crystal (or any similar material) and its special ability to produce electricity, while also having a minimal interaction with light? 

Is the idea that when heat or pressure is applied to the quartz Crystal, the otherwise stable electrons are forced out of position? Does this temporarily change the crystals opacity?

I'm a coin collector. And I've seen silver and gold in grades ranging from ""looks like someone ran this over with a car for pleasure"", to mirror like deep proof finishes on certain coins and bullion. 

I understand most coins aren't ""polished,"" to achieve that mirror like effect you see in some high grade bullion or mint state coins. It's the die pressing to create a very shiny field. 

But that's about all I know. 

When metal is shiny verses when it looks ""rough"" like mild steel vs .999 silver, what exactly is happening to the lattice structure of the crystal matrices to create the gradient from rough or ""satin"" to mirror like?

Are the rough crystal edges being compressed enough to push the molecules closer together to reflect light rather than refract it?

Am I crazy or like, is this total BS? I'm only a little bit versed in stuff like this, so I could just be getting confused from the way he's wording it, but isn't centrifugal force not actually a real force, and just what the subject feels as a result of the centripetal force (being gravity)? How does it repel something? Is a repelling force even needed at all to maintain an orbit?

And regarding the graphic at 0:52, I feel like this is just blatantly incorrect, for one, shouldnt the velocity vector be tangent to circle he's swinging it in?

Even fresh out of the factory, there can be a struggle to keep 75% of the mRNA content intact.

Once thawed, the vaccine is subject to further degradation and Pfizer and Moderna won't disclose how much of the mRNA payload is damaged by the end of their respective storage limits and needs to be discarded.

Let's assume for a moment, that after the Pfizer vaccine is thawed for 5 days as per their guidelines, 15mcg of the 30mcg (50%) of the mRNA is now degraded and renders the vaccine not as effective as is required, so it must be disposed of.

Between the moment it's thawed, and the time it needs to be disposed of, there is a constant accumulation of degraded mRNA in the vial.

We know that intact mRNA will enter your cells for the ""copying system"" in them to use the instructions to create the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is what triggers the immune system to make antibodies against it.

Great... But what about degraded mRNA?
What does degraded mRNA produce?

 [https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/astrazeneca.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/drugs-health-products/covid19-industry/drugs-vaccines-treatments/vaccines/astrazeneca.html)

## How it’s given

The vaccine is given by 2 separate injections of 0.5 mL each into the muscle of the arm. For the vaccine to work best, you need to get 2 doses: a first dose and then a second dose 4 to 12 weeks later.

Immunity develops over time. It takes about 2 weeks to develop significant protection against COVID-19. For the greatest protection, you will need the second dose.  

The AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine showed an effectiveness of about 62% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease beginning 2 weeks after the second dose. This effectiveness rate is based on an analysis of results from participants who had received the 2 dose regimen that will be used in Canada.",2

I have a misshaped nose and glasses and the face gaiter is more comfortable and does a better job at keeping my breath from fogging my glasses, so I prefer that over standard masks and have been using one since December.

Last week I traveled to Florida(for the first time since the pandemic), I wore the gaiter on the way there, but on the way back I was stopped by a flight attendant and asked to switch to another mask. I didn't have another one so they gave me one and I wore it without any questions or argument.

590,askscience,t3_n93sgv,How to interpret efficiency cruves of climb and cruise propellers?,"As far as my understanding goes, in an aircraft, during take-off the rotational speed of the propeller would be large in order to generate enough thrust to take off.

And during cruise, the rotational speed is lowered since the needed thrust is less.

But the efficiency curves of climb (green curve) and cruise (blue curve) propellers tell me otherwise.

See figure 6 of this paper [https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1840\&amp;amp;context=publication](https://commons.erau.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1840&amp;context=publication)

The climb propeller, which is meant to work at high propeller rotational speeds, has low efficiency at these high propeller rotational speeds. The same goes for the cruise propeller which has low efficiency at low rotational speeds. I have searched online, and everyone just takes these curves as they are but I genuinely don't understand the efficiency vs rpm curve.

Shouldn't the curves be switches? The climb propeller has high efficiency at large speeds while the cruise propeller has high efficiency at low speeds?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit: Thank you all for your replies. I would like to clarify a few things. I understood your point that the x-axis of the above link referes to aircraft forward velocity. But I found a similar figure with the x-axis refering explicitly to propeller rpm in figure 8 of this paper [https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8887446?figureId=fig8#fig8](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8887446?figureId=fig8#fig8)

Where propeller 1 is a climb propeller, prop 2 is a cruise prop, and prop 3 is a novel prop optimized for both climb and cruise.

With that I have two misunderstanding still,

1. Why does the climb prop have its peak efficiency at low rpm? Is it beacuse it can generate x amount of thrust for less power, hence it is more efficient? My understanding is that a climb prop is excellent at accleration, meaning it functions well at high rpm and that is why it is 'climb' optimum and not the best for cruising.
2.  I am not sure how to read the efficiency vs rpm curve. Say the propeller is running at 1800 rpm, is it correct to just draw a vertical line at x=1800 rpm and the intersections with the efficiency curve gives you the reading? For example at x=1800, prop 1 has eff = 75% while prop 3 has eff = 62%, or is there something beyond this simple 1-D plot that must be considered?

&amp;#x200B;

Edit 2: Alright eveyone I understood the issue. **I was building on incorrect information** and that's why I was hesistant to accept your answers at first. The climb propeller is supposed to be efficienct at low rpm because that is where you need acceleration to takeoff. After you built enough speed, you start cruising where you run at high rpm and that's also where the efficiency of cruise propeller is at its maximum. Also the second paper is badly written and confused me even more and I should have ignored it 😅. Thanks again to everyone!",1146

637,askscience,t3_n74z66,Do blue LEDs and OLEDs have to output more light to compensate for our relatively low sensitivity to blue wavelengths?,"
**Preamble**:

I know from my physiology courses that the human fovea has around only 2% S-type cone cells, sensitive to wavelengths ~420nm.

In Warren J. Smith's  Modern Optical Engineering - The Design of Optical Systems. 3rd Edition, section 5.3 has a chart that states that, in photopic conditions, λ 420nm have a standard relative luminosity, V(λ), of 0.0040. Compare this with red λ 640nm V(λ) of 0.1750 and green λ 540nm V(λ) of 0.9540.
Edit: Standard relative luminosity is also known as luminous efficacy. [Useful terminology](https://www.ledsmagazine.com/home/article/16701288/radiometric-and-photometric-terms) 


I do not have access to ISO 11664-1:2007 or ISO/CIE 11664-1:2019 to check for more recently evaluated values for wavelength specific sensitivity.


**Questions**:

In photopic light conditions do blue LEDs and OLEDs have to use more power to emit the same amount of perceived light as red or green?

Is this why blue LEDs and OLEDs have a shorter lifespan than other colours?

Are the semiconductor materials/dyes for blue wavelengths inherently less durable or is their durability tied to the greater amount of light they have to emit?",107

640,askscience,t3_n6vv69,"AskScience AMA Series: I am Michael Abramoff, a physician scientist, and also the founder of Digital Diagnostic, that created the first ever FDA approved autonomous AI. AMA!","I am Michael Abramoff, a physician scientist, and also the founder of Digital Diagnostics (formerly IDx, https://dxs.ai), that created the first ever FDA approved autonomous AI. It makes a medical decision without human oversight, and was based on decades of work in neuroscience and neural networks, design of diagnostic AI algorithms, and design of validation trials, in close collaboration with US FDA. This happened in 2018, and I did an AMA here at the time  here: https://www.reddit.com/r/askscience/comments/9d5id2/askscience_ama_series_im_michael_abramoff_a/

Since then, the success of Digital Diagnostics allows me to focus on the deep scientific questions around autonomous AI. What are the ethical issues and dilemmas around autonomous AI in healthcare, and how can we solve these to build an ethical foundation for autonomous AI. This framework then helps guide design, development, validation, regulation, liability issues, implementation and even reimbursement. Read more here: https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajo.2020.02.022, and also in an the issue of the American Journal of Bioethics dedicated to our framework https://doi.org/10.1080/15265161.2020.1819469

Given its almost infinitely scalability, autonomous AI has the potential to do good on a massive scale. Think of improving access, solving health disparities, address health equity issues, lowering cost of care, and improving care quality, to benefit patients is tremendous. At the same time, because the large scale in which it is deployed, it also has the potential to do harm. That is why it needs to be done the right way.

And, thanks to ethical frameworks, we have come far already: inclusion in clinical standards of care, a framework for autonomous AI medical liability, a methodology for autonomous AI's reimbursement incorporating massive cost savings, and most recently a Medicare reimbursement of $55 and more. The healthcare system was built around physicians, nurses, and other human healthcare workers doing ""stuff"". Research studies, peer reviewed publications, FDA approval, ultimately are not enough for changing in clinical practices. So all these steps, and many more, were necessary to get the results of the science of AI to benefit patients.

Now that the technology is real, other companies also have entered the autonomous AI field, we are getting ready to start a trial for a second autonomous AI, for skin cancers, it is time to do another AMA.

I am neuroscientist who started studying neural networks to mimic brain function over 30 years ago. I am also a practicing retina specialist - a physician who specializes in ophthalmology with a fellowship in vitreoretinal surgery -; and a computer scientist, with a MS in Computer Science about artificial neural networks, and a PhD in 2001 on ""AI"" of medical images.

I am founder and executive chairman of Digital Diagnostics, and hence have conflicts of interest. You may also know me as one of the original developers of ImageJ, a widely used open-source image analysis app. I have published over 300 peer reviewed journal papers (h-index 66) on AI and retina, and am inventor on 17 patents and 5 patent applications in this area.

Because my statements are often under FDA, FTC, or CMS oversight and scrutiny, my answers may then seem unnaturally constrained - I will try to explain when that is the case.

641,askscience,t3_n6n82i,How do non-plugin hybrid cars actually use less fuel?,"I know that the basics of a hybrid involves using the electric motor at low speeds, and the ICE at higher speeds. And when the car is using the ICE, it charges the electric motors battery, so that it can be used again.

But how does this save fuel? A basic understanding of the first law of thermodynamics is that energy cannot be created nor destroyed, only transferred. Wouldn’t this mean that the ICE would use *more* fuel while it is charging the electric engine, negating whatever gain it would have gotten? I feel like it would actually be counterintuitive, because the transfer isn’t likely to operate at perfect efficiency.

1. I've always been told by instructors that everything falls with the same rate of acceleration. I've always imagined that there would be variations. Assuming that the drag coefficients or shapes of two objects are the same, could mass not have an effect in a non-vacuum environment. I completely understand that in a vacuum, all objects subjected to the same gravity, and only to that force, accelerate at the same rate. However, in an atmosphere doesn't density matter? I don't know if ""buoyancy"" is the right word to use when speaking of air, but don't objects have different levels of it depending on how their densities compare to that of the air? For example, a balloon filled with air exhaled from the lungs eventually sinks as it is slightly denser than air but it takes a while. Would this effect not apply to all objects. I understand that it would probably be negligible but I am just wondering if it is there.
2. I've always been told that the mass of an object falling is irrelevant to the rate of acceleration. I have seen how it works out mathematically and have always accepted this but have never completed understood why conceptually. All masses have a gravitational acceleration. When I fall to the Earth, it falls to me. Why does it not abide my body's gravitational acceleration. Instructors have always told me that no matter how massive an object is, it will always accelerate to the Earth at 9.81 m/s\^2. Why. If something falls to Jupiter it accelerates at 24.79 m/s\^2. If Earth falls to Jupiter, and Jupiter to Earth, which constant of acceleration is used. If my instructors were correct, Jupiter, no matter how massive will fall to the Earth at 9.81 m/s\^2. How does this work?

668,askscience,t3_n5z8xz,Is the temperature of gas coming out of a compressed tank colder/hotter/the same?,"I've tried googling this but I just keep getting answers about car gas tanks being cold, or why the gas canister itself becomes cold when releasing pressure.

What I want to know is whether the gas *exiting* the tank changes temperature. I understand PV = nRT in the gas tank, but what about when it leaves? Volume goes to (theoretical) infinity and pressure goes to zero? What happens with the temperature?

If I release gas from a room temperature tank of compressed air into a balloon, is the air inside of the balloon now colder, hotter, or room temperature?",1

678,askscience,t3_n551h5,Why don't batteries get drained instantly when shorted?,"Hi, I am starting to learn some electrical science and there is one thing that is confusing me.  Each battery is rated for a limited amount of current hours (more geerally watt hours but the voltage stays constant so it doesn't really matter).  The resistance of a short length of wire is incredibly small.  This then means that the current will also be extremely high, since current is voltage over resistance.  What I don't understand is why the battery doesn't instantly die when shorted.  At first, I thought it was internal resistance, so I meassured the current through the contacts of a nine volt and got a value around 1 microamp.  In my mind this would mean that the internal resistance is massive and the battery should be dead, but I put an LED on it and it lights.  Am I measuring the current wrong? What prevents batteries from instantly draining when shorted?",10

To my understanding, the way we produce mRNA vaccines is through a plasmid, yeah? We take a piece of DNA, insert it into a plasmid, and then into a bacteria for reproduction of that genetic material.

How do event horizons work? How do they grow at all? Or merge?

What exactly is Hawking radiation if matter never actually reaches the horizon? If an observer falls towards a black hole and it eventually evaporates away eons in the future, what do they experience the Hawking radiation as? Is the Hawking radiation exactly matched to cancel out every infalling particle? If a particle is falling towards the horizon what is the process that eventually cancels it out and emits it back into space? Is that how information is preserved?

Also, this weekend I crossed the Appalachians and noticed the wonderful layers apparent there so I tried to figure if the KT boundary could be seen there. 

My first thought is no, because the Appalachians are really really old, Pangea old as far as I read; and the more recent layers have been sheared off by the ice age. So I would asume the KT layer went with it. Is this correct?
Or can the KT layer be seen there?

733,askscience,t3_n2jbpt,Does our position and movement within the galaxy change the speed of light as measured on earth?,"Something ive always wondered. Let's say you measure the speed of light at two different times on earth. The first would be when the rotation of the earth, its orbit around the sun and orbit around the galaxy all sync up with the direction the galaxy is moving in. This would be maximum speed. Then you measure when all factors listed are moving in the opposite direction the galaxy is moving in. Minimum speed.

Since speed of light is consistent regardless of how fast the measurer is moving.(headlights going at 50 mph versus 100,000 mph) does that mean that the difference in measurement is related to how fast the measurer is moving? Example above 99950mph difference in speed of light measured from the two positions?

If you are going 1 mph less than the speed of light and shine a light forward it could only move at 1 mph from your perspective.

So does our movement through the galaxy warp our understanding of speed of light?",7

736,askscience,t3_n2l0ar,What determines the rate of each flu type each flu season?,"Im researching the history of confirmed flu cases each flu season for a specific region, and have found some things that I am interested in learning more about.

Firstly, the amount of confirmed flu cases has generally greatly increased each flu season over the past several years (up to end of 2019), is this because more and more people are actually getting the flu, or more because of increased testing, or something else?

Also, the flu cases are categorized as either Influenza type A or type B. Up until recently, it seemed like the two types were fairly consistent, so if the total flu count increased one season to the next, both types A and B increased, and vice versa. But the last few seasons, it looks something like Type A will see a massive increase while B sees a large decrease and then the next season the opposite occurs and the types fluctuate in count change.

Is there something that determines the rate of each flu type each season? Or is it just by random chance that the consistency no longer applied these past few seasons? Is there different antiviral medications for the different types of flu, or are they treated the same way?

Hope this is the right subreddit for this, as I’m really just looking for more insight and to learn more to explain why I’m seeing what I am while going through the data.

740,askscience,t3_n26xbl,Do children recover from brain damage better than adults?,"I've heard that because of how kids develop, under the age of like 5, who experience brain damage, from strokes or maybe cancerous growths, will ""recover"" better than adults because their body is able to shift were certain activities occur. I use recover lightly as I mean they are able to have a better quality of life after damage occurs compared to adults, not like they actually heal. Sorry if this is a dumb question I just needed to know.",4
741,askscience,t3_n1v4rm,"Why does ""red hepatization"" occur in pneumonia, but pleural effusions are often clear or cloudy/not red?","I'm not sure how clear the question is, but here goes:

So, in lobar pneumonia, microbes get into the lungs, start an inflammatory response, and this attracts fluid, right? So there is congestion in the lobe of the lung because fluid has accumulated. I get that the blood vessels become very full, and so do the alveoli, so I get why exudate would come out of the vessels. But I don't understand why ""red hepatization"" of the lungs occurs - why have red blood cells also come out? When pretty much the same thing happens in pleural effusion - when pulmonary hypertension leads to pleural effusion - the fluid isn't red? How come red blood cells leak out in one case, but not the other?",13

749,askscience,t3_n1h92u,How well can humans perceive pitch?,"For the most part, if you played two consecutive notes, a person should be able to identify which is higher pitch and which is lower pitch, right? 

And if you played three consecutive notes, you should be able to identify the same thing between notes 1 and 2, and then 2 and 3, simply because those notes were played adjacent to each other, so the comparison is the same. 

But if you played 3 consecutive notes, would a person be able to tell which was higher pitched, note 1 or 3, completely ignoring note 2? 

The reason I ask is because they're interrupted by note 2, so it isn't a side by side comparison. The method a person typically uses to identify the difference in pitch between two notes (comparing them side by side) doesn't apply to here, so could a person still do it?",18

In the case of monoclonal antibodies there is the generation of antibodies against the used MC-antibodies but as far as I know the risk of immunogenicity gets lower with higher amount of ""human"" parts of the antibody. Does this happen because the constant region of antibodies is a highly conserved sequence (not sure if it is?) so production of antibodies against this region is unlikely or is there a completely different mechanism involved?

In the case of HEK proteins or proteins from other humans in general how does immune response look like? Why does the immune response to proteins from other humans not matter (blood donation) but in other cases it does? Is there some fundamental building block I am missing?",37
753,askscience,t3_n12bm5,Why are Blue Holes anoxic?,"I've been reading up on blue holes and discovered that DO levels start depleting around the rim of the sinkhole and eventually become anoxic at depths.

   Why does this occur?

761,askscience,t3_n0fggu,AskScience AMA Series: We are genetics experts here to discuss how underrepresentation of some populations in research can impact medicine and health. Ask us anything!,"
Overall, humans are remarkably similar at the genomic level - two unrelated people share about 99.9% of their DNA sequences. However, the small percentage that does differ can hold important genetic clues about our traits and health. Important discoveries in human genetics and genomics often rely on comparing groups of people, for example people with a given disease compared to people without the disease. These studies utilize genomic data from individuals who have contributed their DNA for research purposes, most of which (approximately 80%) are individuals of European ancestry, yet 16% of the global population is made up of people of European ancestry. The failure to include some populations in genetic studies means researchers are likely missing discoveries that can benefit everyone, and results can have limited utility across different populations.

 We're here to discuss the [2021 DNA Day Essay Contest question](https://www.ashg.org/dna-day/), which asked high school students around the world to address how population representation impacts genomic findings and whether inclusion of more diverse populations in genetic and genomic studies holds a potential to benefit future genetic research and improve human health.

Some groups who are working to improve population representation in genetic and genomic research include:

+ The Human Heredity and Health in Africa Initiative (H3Africa), which is collecting genetic samples from participants in 27 African countries, as well as funding African investigators working in African institutions.https://h3africa.org/index.php/about/
+ The Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) Consortium, which will genotype approximately 50,000 individuals from non-European populations. https://www.pagestudy.org/
+ The All of Us Research Program, which plans to recruit one million American individuals - at least half of whom are of non-European ancestry - to learn more about how differences in lifestyle, environment, and genetics influence health and disease. https://www.joinallofus.org/

The American Society of Human Genetics is a partner in organizing today's AMA. For more information on human genetics and genomics, check out their Discover Genetics page: https://www.ashg.org/discover-genetics/. And, for more information on this year’s Essay Contest question, check out this fact sheet: https://www.ashg.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/DG_FactSheet_PopRepresentation_v5.pdf

Our group today includes:

+ Marina DiStefano, PhD (u/Marina_DiStefano) - I am an assistant professor and clinical molecular geneticist in the Geisinger Precision Health Program and an affiliate member at the Broad Institute. I lead the Broad-based ClinGen biocuration team and work with multiple Consortiums to develop and set standards for curation data available to the public.

The main infinite-dimensional Hilbert space you'd want to use in quantum mechanics is the space of square integrable functions... which *is* a Hilbert space, *provided* 1) you use Lebesgue integration, 2) you identify functions which differ on a set of measure 0, and 3) you include very badly behaved functions (not necessarily differentiable or even continuous *anywhere*).

But then wouldn't that mean that the momentum operator is not actually an operator on this space, given the momentum operator involves a derivative and the space includes nowhere differentiable functions? How does this make sense?

So why is completeness a *requirement*, if the only thing it seems to do is require you to include badly behaved functions (which then makes the operators on the space ill-defined for some inputs)? Why not just say ""inner product space"" (which *could* be complete, but doesn't have to be)?",13

I've suggested re-culturing with untreated media after adaptation, and seeing if there's a difference in growth rate compared to the first generation (since resistant mutantions are usually expensive). But the concern was brought up that this would quickly select for ***back*** mutation of the original resistance mutation, leaving us uncertain of how to proceed.

Between 1909 and 1911, Geiger and Marsden did experiments in which they aimed alpha particles at gold foil. The amount of deviation and deflection of these particles lead to the new model of atom where a large amount of charge and mass are in the center of the atom in a nucleus.

Later on in 1917 the proton was discovered. Later on in 1930, Irene Joliot Curie and her husband, Fredric, used alpha particles to find an unknown radiation, which was neutral. James Chadwick then discovered the neutron. 

My question is, how is it that even before the discovery of proton, the alpha particles were being used. Also after the discovery of proton, it took some long time for neutron to be discovered. What was assumed to be the structure of an alpha particle before and after the discovery of proton? Was it assumed that alpha particles are entirely made of proton?

I am a molecular engineer scientist by trade and I am curious about biosensors that respond to environmental stimuli.

 I would like to know exactly what is happening on the cellular level of these plants that makes them dramatically change their appearance depending if the plant is grown in high or low light, warm or cool, etc. I suspect there are some transcription factors responding to the environment and controlling the expression of pigment or chlorophyll genes, developmentally, as the plant grows new tissue. 

But which transcription factors? I would like to read peer reviewed papers about their response to stimuli, look at crystal structures, etc

For example I found a transcription factor in Arabidopsis that receives light then translocates into the nucleus where it begins its gene expression program. I want to learn on this level of detail for my observed phenotypes.

Especially interested in the variegation patterns... How are the stripes and patches formed developmentally? I assume some cycled gene expression pattern?

The N (nucleocapsid) and ORF8 proteins are both internal to the virus membrane. AFAIK they are not expressed on the outside of the virus.

\- Since they are not expressed on the outside of the virus like the S, M, and E proteins, how are antibodies created for it?

\- Since they are not expressed on the outside of the virus like the S, M, and E proteins, how are antibodies able to bind to the N and ORF8 proteins of virus particles?  


My guess:  


When the virus enters a host cell, the process of viral replication within the host cell cytoplasm creates the individual N and ORF8 proteins, and not all of them are assembled into new virions. Some N and ORF8 proteins (along with other viral proteins) migrate out of the cytoplasm and are expressed on the surface of the host cell (why?).

The immune system then creates antibodies for these proteins that are normally internal to the virus. 

Antibodies identify infected host cells based on their exterior expression of these normally-internal viral proteins, and agglutinate/mark these host cells for destruction.",3

For example, would somebody with a weaker immune system be able to eventually, given more time, produce just as many immune cells and antibodies as somebody with a stronger immune system? Or is it basically just a race to see how many you can produce within a set time interval (like 2 weeks)?

Second, Many of you pointed out that on the Nuvaring website it states it cannot be removed for &amp;gt;3 hours, however, both [Planned Parenthood](https://www.plannedparenthood.org/learn/birth-control/birth-control-vaginal-ring-nuvaring/what-should-i-do-if-i-mess-up-using-nuvaring) and [UC Berkeley](https://uhs.berkeley.edu/sites/default/files/nuvaring.pdf) state that it is still effective for up to 48 hours. So a follow-up question would be why do both Berkeley and Planned Parenthood (both reputable sources) state 48 hours as the limit?

EDIT 2: 
Okay I’m tired of people saying “are you sure you interpreted Planned Parenthood/Berkeley correctly?” So here is a direct quote from the Berkeley source listed above:

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; [for] delayed insertion of a new ring **or delayed reinsertion of a current ring for &amp;lt;48 hours** since a ring should have been inserted
• Insert ring as soon as possible.
• Keep the ring in until the scheduled ring removal day
• **No additional contraceptive protection is needed**

And a quote from Planned Parenthood:

&amp;gt;&amp;gt; ...sometimes the NuvaRing might slip out of your vagina. If the ring has been out of your vagina for less than 2 days, rinse it in cool water and put it back in right away. **If you put it back in within 48 hours, you’ll still be protected from pregnancy.**

EDIT 3: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/65/rr/rr6504a1.htm#F-1-4_down) and [WHO](https://www.who.int/reproductivehealth/publications/family_planning/SPR-3/en/) (see page 52) also recommend the &amp;lt;48hr rule",3648

I think I heard somewhere that electric engines are more or less equally efficient at any RPM. If that is true (is it?), then is there a cruise speed for electric vehicles?

929,askscience,t3_muj7qm,How vertical is space?,"So this is a question that has crossed my mind a few times before and I've never really come across a clear answer. 

To explain the question further: space in models is often depicted as flat, as in, it has x and z dimensions, and the only y value commonly depicted is from the size of various objects.

I suppose that in some depictions there is some when looking at like asteroid fields and smaller celestial objects. But I digress. 

My understanding is that there is no real up or down in space, but there would be some sort y value in 3D space, no? Do we have a reference as to where things are located on the y value compared to us? 

Like can we tell easily if a galaxy or solar system is ""perpendicular"" to us based on the North Pole and how that relates to the various orbits of planets in our solar system to the sun.

Is that vertical positioning important or relevant to our study of space, or space travel?

If it wasn't clear from the title, what I am curious about is the timeline of the development of language in humans compared to the timeline of our spread across the planet, and what evidence we have if each. I know there's pretty ample evidence of how, when, and where we spread out, but what's the earliest evidence we have of language, written or otherwise? And if language developed first, is there any hope of ever reconstructing the first human language? Or if language developed later, did it develop near simultaneously and independently?

936,askscience,t3_mu6sda,How does evolution change the number of chromosomes of a species?,"I’m far from a biologist but one question that’s always confused me slightly about evolution: how does the number of chromosomes a species have change? 

So in school I was taught a horse and a donkey can have offspring called a mule, these cannot reproduce as horses and donkeys have a different number of chromosomes so the offspring cannot produce children as the chromosomes they have can’t line up. But presumably horses and donkeys somewhere share a common ancestor so how did this branching happen as if a random mutation gave one of this species a different number of chromosomes, even in an isolated group, surely it wouldn’t be able to produce fertile offspring to carry on this mutation so that branch should have died; you can’t gradually change the number of chromosomes you either have more or less than normal and that’s an integer value?

I recently was reading about how rocket engines have to maintain a high pressure in their combustion chambers so that the gas exiting the nozzle is above the speed of sound and therefore accelerates as it expands.  This was the opposite of what I learned in my entry-level physics class and a bit of quick research made me realize Bernoulli’s equations are far more complicated at higher velocities of gas.  Thinking about airplanes and how they normally generate lift by forcing air to accelerate over the top of a wing/create a low pressure area that ‘pulls’ the wing up, it doesn’t make sense to me that they would still be able to generate lift if the air over the wing is forced to accelerate (faster molecules = higher pressure right?).

That was over a year ago, though, so I resume it has been revised since then.

From [studies we see that algae and fungi can form symbiotic relationships relatively quickly](https://elifesciences.org/articles/47815)

When looking at the morphology of plant roots , they are very similar to fungal hyphae . Also, the symbiosis between plants roots and fungi mimic the relationships between fungi themselves, sharing nutrients over long distances. Spores , the basis of reproduction , are also a shared characteristic .  Something I don’t think many protists have .

How can we be so sure that plants are not simply an evolution of fungi structures that house algae ?

These extensions would grow bigger and bigger to maximize production .",0

986,askscience,t3_mrcaea,AskScience AMA Series: We're a group of scientists working on the next generation of solvents for more sustainable chemistry. Ask us anything!,"Solvents are used in a variety of applications - from paints and electronics to pharmaceuticals and agrochemical production. Yet, many pose a hazard to human health and the environment, which means it's more important than ever to create safer, more sustainable alternatives.

We're exploring new applications for bio-based solvents, such as Cyrene™ - a dipolar aprotic solvent that is derived from cellulose and produced in one step from levoglucosenone (LGO), a versatile chemical building block. This solvent can be used for the production and development of active pharmaceutical ingredients, the engineering of plastics and the manufacturing and recycling of electronic components.

In addition to determining new applications for Cyrene™ solvent, we're also working on further developments for other LGO derivatives. These next-gen solvents can play a crucial role in more sustainable chemistry. For example, when compared to N-methyl-2-pyrrolione (NMP) and dimethylformamide (DMF), two solvents under increasing regulatory restrictions due to their toxicity, Cyrene™ solvent offers superior performance in some applications. Additionally, its low toxicity falls well below the hazard thresholds defined by the Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals.

988,askscience,t3_msdjc0,"Is there any known method, given ¬CH, to construct a set whose cardinality is between the integers and the reals?","My understanding of the Continuum Hypothesis is that, because it's independent of ZFC, you can essentially choose to do mathematics given that it's true *or* given that it's false, like the axiom of choice. Unless a more powerful set of axioms is found which can prove CH.

So, if you take it as false, can a method be found to construct a set that's larger than the integers and smaller than the reals? More generally, do mathematicians have any intuition of what sets between N and R would look like under ¬CH?",3
989,askscience,t3_ms5cod,Do single-eyed people behave (slightly/in certain tasks) differently depending on which eye is the healty one? (because of the fact that there are two brain hemispheres).,"If the sides of our brain specialize in different tasks, then I assume that there should be a difference in behaviour depending on the side that is processing the visual information.

This question came to me after watching CGP Grey's video about the two brain sides [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8)

&amp;#x200B;

Of course the two sides are connected (well except when they are not), but this fact shouldt change too much how informations is processed because of the locality of the processing.",12
990,askscience,t3_mrx4rn,How do T cells recognize the S protein as an antigen on MHC-1 for the mRNA covid vaccine if it is foreign?,"I've scoured the internet to find this, and a lot of answers are along the lines of ""yeah your body just know that the S protein = bad when presented on MHC-1."" As you can expect, this isn't very informative.

From my understanding, the mRNA vaccine doesn't secrete the S protein extracellularly either, so they aren't phagocytized by an antigen-presenting cell. 

I was thinking maybe there's a specific T cell that binds to MHC-1 and somehow has a receptor for that S protein? Is this the case? Because there is a huge variation of T-cells made with different receptors right? 


 1. If this is the case, isn't it quite ineffective to wait for a T-cell to come along with maybe a 1 in a million chance of having a receptor that binds to the S protein (Covid spike protein)? 


 2. Is there another way that our body recognizes the S protein as an antigen?",51
991,askscience,t3_ms28yt,Where does the mass go when not conserved in chemical reactions?,"I have read that mass changes in chemical reactions, for example through making and breaking bonds, but it is too small to detect. In balanced equations for non-nuclear reactions, there are the same number of protons, neutrons and electrons on both sides. If the equation is balanced, where is the mass change? Do the electrons/neutrons/protons slightly change their mass, or is the mass change hidden somewhere else?",9
992,askscience,t3_ms7f70,What gives red and purple skin rashes their color?,Are allergic or drug induced vasculitis rashes red because of leaky blood vessels and increased oxygenated blood/RBCs to that area?

993,askscience,t3_mrxqc9,Why don't we see any main sequence Red Giants or Blue Dwarfs?,"Pretty simple question, probably with a pretty simple answer. Blue Dwarfs are a theoretical stage of life for Red Dwarfs, that much I know, but why don't we see any small main sequence Blue stars? Is it just not possible to get that hot and that small? And the same goes for Red Giants - all the big stars seem to be Blue. Why are none of them Red? Why is that only the dying stage of a larger star?",16

995,askscience,t3_mrtqhw,What causes a metallic taste after Pfizer’s COVID-19 vaccination?,"Some patients report having a strange, persistent metallic taste after being vaccinated with Pfizer’s mRNA vaccine.

This has been reported by news outlets as a “phenomenon”. For example, NBC News: https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1261944.

I was wondering if any biologists, doctors, etc. could provide a biological explanation for this side effect. 

Disclaimer: I received Pfizer myself today, and I experienced this rare effect. This post is not meant to deter vaccination in anyone. It just seemed like a good question.",24
996,askscience,t3_ms45w6,Do SSRIs (Selective serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors) cause an increase in serotonin receptors in the brain?,"So I remember that I've read somewhere that when coffee is consumed regularly your body will develop a tolerance to it by increasing the number of adenosine receptors in your brain which will cause it to lose its effect.

However, when initially taking SSRIs, they do not have any effect on you whatsoever, they only start working after 1 to 3 weeks of taking them and they will reach their full effect after even more weeks have passed.

So my question is: Do SSRIs increase the number of serotonin receptors in your brain just like how coffee does for adenosine, causing them to lose their effect in the long run? If not, why is that the case for SSRIs and not for coffee?",2

That's a question about any similar disease really. If someone has acquired immunity through infection, and afterwards frequently comes into contact with carriers, does that boost their immunity (because there's ""reminder"" for the immune system of what to fight with) or does that increase risk of re-infection (because of prolonged exposure and concentration of viruses)?",18
